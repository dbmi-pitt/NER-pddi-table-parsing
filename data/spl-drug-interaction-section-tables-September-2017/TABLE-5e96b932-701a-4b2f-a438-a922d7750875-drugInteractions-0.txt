<td stylecode="Rrule Botrule">Long-term lithium therapy can result in goiter in up to 50% of patients, and either subclinical or overt hypothyroidism, each in up to 20% of patients. The fetus, neonate, elderly and euthyroid patients with underlying thyroid disease (e.g., Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or with Grave’s disease previously treated with radioiodine or surgery) are among those individuals who are particularly susceptible to iodine-induced hypothyroidism. Oral cholecystographic agents and amiodarone are slowly excreted, producing more prolonged hypothyroidism than parenterally administered iodinated contrast agents. Long-term aminoglutethimide therapy may minimally decrease T
     <sub>4</sub> and T
     <sub>3</sub> levels and increase TSH, although all values remain within normal limits in most patients.

<td stylecode="Rrule Botrule">Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T

     <sub>4</sub> levels change slightly, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. It should be noted that actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when the hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T
     <sub>3</sub> concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T
     <sub>4</sub> levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T
