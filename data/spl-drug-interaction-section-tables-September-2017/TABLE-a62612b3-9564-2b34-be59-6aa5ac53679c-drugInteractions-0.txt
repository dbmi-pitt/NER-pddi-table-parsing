<td>Celecoxib and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of celecoxib and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.</td>

<td>Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [<content stylecode="italics">see <linkhtml href="#S5.2"> Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkhtml>
</content>]. In two studies in healthy volunteers, and in patients with osteoarthritis and established heart disease respectively, celecoxib (200-400 mg daily) has demonstrated a lack of interference with the cardioprotective antiplatelet effect of aspirin (100-325 mg).</td>
