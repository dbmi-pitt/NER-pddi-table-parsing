<td stylecode="Rrule">Tizanidine</td>
<td stylecode="Rrule">Contraindicated</td>
<td>Concomitant administration of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin is contraindicated due to the potentiation of hypotensive and sedative effects of tizanidine [<content stylecode="italics">see <linkhtml href="#S4.2">Contraindications (4.2)</linkhtml>

<td stylecode="Rrule">Avoid Use<br/>(Plasma Exposure Likely to be Increased and Prolonged)</td>
<td>Concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin with theophylline may result in increased risk of a patient developing central nervous system (CNS) or other adverse reactions. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor serum levels of theophylline and adjust dosage as appropriate [<content stylecode="italics">see <linkhtml href="#S5.9">Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</linkhtml>

<td>Hypoglycemia sometimes severe has been reported when ciprofloxacin and oral antidiabetic agents, mainly<br/>sulfonylureas (for example, glyburide, glimepiride), were co-administered, presumably by intensifying the action of the oral antidiabetic agent. Fatalities have been reported<content stylecode="italics">. </content>Monitor blood glucose when ciprofloxacin is co-administered with oral antidiabetic drugs [<content stylecode="italics">see <linkhtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkhtml>

<td stylecode="Rrule">Phenytoin</td>
<td stylecode="Rrule">Use with caution<br/>Altered serum levels of phenytoin (increased and decreased)</td>
<td>To avoid the loss of seizure control associated with decreased phenytoin levels and to prevent phenytoin overdose-related adverse reactions upon ciprofloxacin discontinuation in patients receiving both agents, monitor phenytoin therapy, including phenytoin serum concentration during and shortly after co-administration of ciprofloxacin with phenytoin.</td>

<td stylecode="Rrule">Anti-coagulant drugs</td>
<td stylecode="Rrule">Use with caution<br/>(Increase in anticoagulant effect)</td>
<td>The risk may vary with the underlying infection, age and general status of the patient so that the contribution of ciprofloxacin to the increase in INR (international normalized ratio) is difficult to assess. Monitor prothrombin time and INR frequently during and shortly after co-administration of ciprofloxacin with an oral anticoagulant (for example, warfarin).</td>
