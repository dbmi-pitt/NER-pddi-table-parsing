<paragraph>If coadministration of methadone and didanosine is necessary, the recommended formulation of didanosine is VIDEX EC. Patients should be closely monitored for adequate clinical response when VIDEX EC is coadministered with methadone, including monitoring for changes in HIV RNA viral load. Do not coadminister methadone with VIDEX pediatric powder due to significant decreases in didanosine concentrations. </paragraph>
