</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Clinical Impact: </td>
<td> • Naproxen and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of naproxen and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.   <br/>· Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Intervention: </td>
<td> Monitor patients with concomitant use of naproxen sodium with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (<linkhtml href="#_bfa2f1d6-3f03-5d12-5538-4dc4a67c86aa">5.11</linkhtml>)]. </td>

<content stylecode="bold">Aspirin </content>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Clinical Impact: </td>
<td> Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (<linkhtml href="#_c0cc92fa-88a7-2d3f-a04e-293c021d0d7f">5.2)]. </linkhtml>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Intervention: </td>
<td> • Concomitant use of naproxen sodium and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (<linkhtml href="#_bfa2f1d6-3f03-5d12-5538-4dc4a67c86aa">5.11</linkhtml>)]. <br/>• Naproxen sodium tablets are not substitutes for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. </td>

<content stylecode="bold">ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers </content>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Clinical Impact: </td>
<td> • NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol). <br/> • In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Intervention: </td>
<td> • During concomitant use of naproxen sodium and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. <br/>• During concomitant use of naproxen sodium and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (<linkhtml href="#_7563ca3c-6f35-2ee0-7ccf-ba48abd5c94a">5.6</linkhtml>)]. <br/>• When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. </td>

<content stylecode="bold">Diuretics </content>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Clinical Impact: </td>
<td> Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Intervention: </td>
<td> During concomitant use of naproxen sodium with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (<linkhtml href="#_7563ca3c-6f35-2ee0-7ccf-ba48abd5c94a">5.6)</linkhtml>]. </td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td> Clinical Impact: </td>
<td> NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance.
