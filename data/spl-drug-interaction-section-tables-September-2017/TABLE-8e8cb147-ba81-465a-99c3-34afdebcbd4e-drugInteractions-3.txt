<tr>
<td colspan="2" stylecode="T Botrule Rrule">Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased.</td>

<td align="left" stylecode="Toprule Botrule Rrule">Beta-adrenergic antagonists
            
    
     <br/>(e.g., Propranolol &gt; 160 mg/day)
           
   
    </td>
<td align="left" stylecode="Toprule Botrule Rrule">In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (&gt; 160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state.</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td align="left" stylecode="Toprule Botrule Rrule">Glucocorticoids
            
    
     <br/>(e.g., Dexamethasone 
            
    
     <content stylecode="underline">&gt;</content> 4 mg/day)
           
   
    </td>
<td align="left" stylecode="Toprule Botrule Rrule">Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (See above).</td>
</tr>

<td align="left" stylecode="Toprule Botrule Rrule">Other drugs:
            
    
     <br/>Amiodarone
           
   
    </td>
<td align="left" stylecode="Toprule Botrule Rrule">Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients.</td>
