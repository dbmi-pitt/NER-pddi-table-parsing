<tr>
<td> Clinical Impact:   </td>
<td> The effect of PPIs on antiretroviral drugs is variable. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known. <br/>• Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine, atazanavir and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with omeprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance [see Clinical Pharmacology <linkhtml href="#PHARMACOKINETICS">(12.3)</linkhtml>]. <br/>• Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with omeprazole may increase toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology <linkhtml href="#PHARMACOKINETICS">(12.3)</linkhtml>]. <br/>• There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with omeprazole. </td>
