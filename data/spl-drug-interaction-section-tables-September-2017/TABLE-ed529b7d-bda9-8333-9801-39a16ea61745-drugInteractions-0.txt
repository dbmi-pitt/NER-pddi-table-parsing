<td>The concomitant use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen and CYP2D6 inhibitors may result in an increase in the plasma concentration of tramadol and a decrease in the plasma concentration of M1, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen is achieved. Since M1 is a more potent Âµ-opioid agonist, decreased M1 exposure could result in decreased therapeutic effects, and may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal in patients who had developed physical dependence to tramadol. Increased tramadol exposure can result in increased or prolonged therapeutic effects and increased risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome.<content stylecode="bold"></content>
<br/>
<br/>After stopping a CYP2D6 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the tramadol plasma concentration will decrease and the M1 plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong therapeutic effects but also increase adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity, and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression <content stylecode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkhtml href="#_287a0b3f-da62-33c9-2fce-b1424db08f51">12.3</linkhtml>)]</content>.</td>

<br/>Patients taking carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of tramadol hydrochloride, acetaminophen and carbamazepine is not recommended.</td>
