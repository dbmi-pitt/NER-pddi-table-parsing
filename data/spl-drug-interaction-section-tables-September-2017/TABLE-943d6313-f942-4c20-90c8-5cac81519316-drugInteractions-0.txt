<paragraph>• Mefenamic acid and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of mefenamic acid and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph>• Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. </paragraph>
