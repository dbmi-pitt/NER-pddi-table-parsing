<paragraph>If coadministration of methadone and didanosine is necessary, the recommended formulation of didanosine is didanosine delayed-release capsules. Patients should be closely monitored for adequate clinical response when didanosine delayed-release capsules are coadministered with methadone, including monitoring for changes in HIV RNA viral load. Do not coadminister methadone with didanosine pediatric powder due to significant decreases in didanosine concentrations. </paragraph>

<paragraph>A dose reduction of didanosine delayed-release capsules to the following dosage once daily taken together with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a light meal (400 kcalories or less and 20% fat or less) or in the fasted state is recommended.<footnote id="_Ref459719175">Coadministration of didanosine with food decreases didanosine concentrations. Thus, although not studied, it is possible that coadministration with heavier meals could reduce didanosine concentrations further.</footnote>
