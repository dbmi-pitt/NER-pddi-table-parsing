<br/>If coadministration of methadone and didanosine is necessary, the recommended formulation of didanosine is didanosine delayed-release capsules. Patients<br/>should be closely monitored for adequate clinical response when didanosine delayed-release capsules is coadministered with methadone, including monitoring<br/>for changes in HIV RNA viral load. Do not coadminister methadone with didanosine pediatric powder due to significant decreases in didanosine concentrations.</td>
