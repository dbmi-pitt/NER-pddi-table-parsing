<td>↑ anticancer agents</td>
<td>Concentrations of vincristine or vinblastine may be increased when co-administered with lopinavir/ritonavir (KALETRA) resulting in the potential for increased adverse events usually associated with these anticancer agents.  <br/>
<br/>Consideration should be given to temporarily withholding the ritonavir-containing antiretroviral regimen in patients who develop significant hematologic or gastrointestinal side effects when lopinavir/ritonavir ( KALETRA) is administered concurrently with vincristine or vinblastine.  If the antiretroviral regimen must be withheld for a prolonged period, consideration should be given to initiating a revised regimen that does not include a CYP3A or P-gp inhibitor.  </td>

<td>KALETRA may be less effective due to decreased lopinavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly and should be used with caution.<br/>KALETRA should not be administered once daily in combination with carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin.<br/>
<br/>In addition, co-administration of phenytoin and KALETRA may cause decreases in steady-state phenytoin concentrations.  Phenytoin levels should be monitored when co-administering with KALETRA. </td>

<td>↓ bupropion<br/>↓ active metabolite, <br/>hydroxybupropion</td>

<td>Antidepressant:<br/>trazodone<br/>

<td>↑ trazodone</td>
<td>Concomitant use of trazodone and KALETRA may increase concentrations of trazodone.  Adverse reactions of nausea, dizziness, hypotension and syncope have been observed following co-administration of trazodone and ritonavir.  If trazodone is used with a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ritonavir, the combination should be used with caution and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered.</td>

<td>Antifungals:<br/>ketoconazole*,<br/>itraconazole,<br/>voriconazole</td>
<td>↑ ketoconazole<br/>↑ itraconazole<br/>↓ voriconazole </td>
<td>High doses of ketoconazole (&gt;200 mg/day) or itraconazole (&gt; 200 mg/day) are not recommended.  <br/>Co-administration of voriconazole with KALETRA has not been studied.  However, a study has been shown that administration of voriconazole with ritonavir 100 mg every 12 hours decreased voriconazole steady-state AUC by an average of 39%; therefore, co-administration of KALETRA and voriconazole may result in decreased voriconazole concentrations and the potential for decreased voriconazole effectiveness and should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole.  Otherwise, alternative antifungal therapies should be considered in these patients.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Antimycobacterial:<br/>rifabutin*</td>
<td>↑ rifabutin and rifabutin metabolite</td>
<td>Dosage reduction of rifabutin by at least 75% of the usual dose of 300 mg/day is recommended (i.e., a maximum dose of 150 mg every other day or three times per week).  Increased monitoring for adverse reactions is warranted in patients receiving the combination.  Further dosage reduction of rifabutin may be necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Antimycobacterial:<br/>rifampin</td>
<td>↓ lopinavir</td>
<td>May lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to KALETRA or to the class of protease inhibitors or other co-administered antiretroviral agents.  A study evaluated combination of rifampin 600 mg once daily, with KALETRA 800/200 mg twice daily or KALETRA 400/100 mg + ritonavir 300 mg twice daily.  Pharmacokinetic and safety results from this study do not allow for a dose recommendation.  Nine subjects (28%) experienced a ≥ grade 2 increase in ALT/AST, of which seven (21%) prematurely discontinued study per protocol.  Based on the study design, it is not possible to determine whether the frequency or magnitude of the ALT/AST elevations observed is higher than what would be seen with rifampin alone.  <content stylecode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkhtml href="#section_12.3">12.3</linkhtml>) for magnitude of interaction]</content>.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Benzodiazepines: parenterally administered midazolam</td>
<td>↑ midazolam</td>
<td>Midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Increases in the concentration of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher with oral than parenteral administration.  Therefore, KALETRA should not be given with orally administered midazolam <content stylecode="italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</content>. If KALETRA is coadministered with parenteral midazolam, close clinical monitoring for respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation should be exercised and dosage adjustment should be considered.</td>

<td>Use with caution.  KALETRA may be less effective due to decreased lopinavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>disulfiram/metronidazole</td>
<td></td>
<td>KALETRA oral solution contains alcohol, which can produce disulfiram-like reactions when co-administered with disulfiram or other drugs that produce this reaction (e.g., metronidazole).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PDE5 inhibitors:<br/>sildenafil,<br/>tadalafil,<br/>vardenafil</td>
<td>↑ sildenafil<br/>↑ tadalafil<br/>↑ vardenafil</td>
<td>Particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil in patients receiving KALETRA. Co-administration of KALETRA with these drugs is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in an increase in associated adverse reactions including hypotension, syncope, visual changes and prolonged erection.  It is recommended not to exceed the following doses:<list listtype="unordered">
<item>Sildenafil: 25 mg every 48 hours</item>
<item>Tadalafil: 10 mg every 72 hours</item>
<item>Vardenafil: 2.5 mg every 72 hours</item>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Immunosuppressants:<br/>cyclosporine,<br/>tacrolimus,<br/>rapamycin</td>
<td>↑ immunosuppressants</td>
<td>Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for immunosuppressant agents when co-administered with KALETRA.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Inhaled Steroid:<br/>fluticasone</td>
<td>↑ fluticasone</td>
<td>Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and KALETRA may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations.  Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported during post-marketing use in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate. Co-administration of fluticasone propionate and KALETRA is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Narcotic Analgesic:<br/>methadone*</td>
<td>↓ methadone</td>
<td>Dosage of methadone may need to be increased when co-administered with KALETRA.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contraceptive:<br/>ethinyl estradiol*</td>
<td>↓ ethinyl estradiol</td>
<td>Because contraceptive steroid concentrations may be altered when KALETRA is co-administered with oral contraceptives or with the contraceptive patch, alternative methods of nonhormonal contraception are recommended.</td>
