<td>Long-term lithium therapy can result in goiter in up to 50% of patients, and either subclinical or overt hypothyroidism, each in up to 20% of patients.  The fetus, neonate, elderly and euthyroid patients with underlying thyroid disease (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis or with Grave's disease previously treated with radioiodine or surgery) are among those individuals who are particularly susceptible to iodine-induced hypothyroidism.  Oral cholecystographic agents and amiodarone are slowly excreted, producing more prolonged hypothyroidism than parenterally administered iodinated contrast agents.  Long-term aminoglutethimide therapy may minimally decrease T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> levels and increase TSH, although all values remain within normal limits in most patients.</td>

<td>Iodide and drugs that contain pharmacologic amounts of iodide may cause hyperthyroidism in euthyroid patients with Grave's disease previously treated with antithyroid drugs or in euthyroid patients with thyroid autonomy (e.g., multinodular goiter or hyperfunctioning thyroid adenoma).  Hyperthyroidism may develop over several weeks and may persist for several months after therapy discontinuation.  Amiodarone may induce hyperthyroidism by causing thyroiditis.</td>

<td>Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of levothyroxine by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism.  Calcium carbonate may form an insoluble chelate with levothyroxine, and ferrous sulfate likely forms a ferric-thyroxine complex.  Administer levothyroxine at least 4 hours apart from these agents. Patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and levothyroxine should be monitored for changes in thyroid function.</td>

<td>Administration of these agents with levothyroxine results in an initial transient increase in FT<sub>4</sub>.  Continued administration results in a decrease in serum T<sub>4</sub> and normal FT<sub>4</sub> and TSH concentrations and, therefore, patients are clinically euthyroid.  Salicylates inhibit binding of T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> to TBG and transthyretin.  An initial increase in serum FT<sub>4</sub> is followed by return of FT<sub>4</sub> to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total-T<sub>4</sub> levels may decrease by as much as 30%.</td>

<td>Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub>, leading to decreased T<sub>3</sub> levels.  However, serum T<sub>4</sub> levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased.  In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (&gt; 160 mg/day), T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> levels change slightly, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid.  It should be noted that actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when the hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state.  Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T<sub>3</sub> concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T<sub>4</sub> levels.  However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> levels due to decreased TBG production (see above).</td>

<td>Anticoagulants (oral)<br/>- Coumarin Derivatives<br/>- Indandione Derivatives</td>
<td>Thyroid hormones appear to increase the catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, thereby increasing the anticoagulant activity of oral anticoagulants.  Concomitant use of these agents impairs the compensatory increases in clotting factor synthesis.  Prothrombin time should be carefully monitored in patients taking levothyroxine and oral anticoagulants and the dose of anticoagulant therapy adjusted accordingly.</td>

<td>Concurrent use of tri/tetracyclic antidepressants and levothyroxine may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines.  Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and CNS stimulation; onset of action of tricyclics may be accelerated.  Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on levothyroxine may result in increased levothyroxine requirements.</td>

<td>Cytokines<br/>- Interferon-α<br/>- Interleukin-2</td>
<td>Therapy with interferon-α has been associated with the development of antithyroid microsomal antibodies in 20% of patients and some have transient hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or both.  Patients who have antithyroid antibodies before treatment are at higher risk for thyroid dysfunction during treatment.  Interleukin-2 has been associated with transient painless thyroiditis in 20% of patients.  Interferon-β and -γ have not been reported to cause thyroid dysfunction.</td>
