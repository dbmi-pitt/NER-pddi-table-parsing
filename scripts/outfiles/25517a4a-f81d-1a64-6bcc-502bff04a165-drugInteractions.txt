                        When administered concomitantly with midodrine HCl, cardiac glycosides may enhance or precipitate bradycardia, A.V. block or arrhythmia. The use of drugs that stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine or dihydroergotamine) may enhance or potentiate the pressor effects of midodrine HCl. Therefore, caution should be used when midodrine HCl tablets are administered concomitantly with agents that cause vasoconstriction.
                        Midodrine HCl has been used in patients concomitantly treated with salt-retaining steroid therapy (i.e., fludrocortisone acetate), with or without salt supplementation. The potential for supine hypertension should be carefully monitored in these patients and may be minimized by either reducing the dose of fludrocortisone acetate or decreasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with midodrine HCl. Alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, such as prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin, can antagonize the effects of midodrine HCl.
