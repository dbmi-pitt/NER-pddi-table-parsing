                  7.1 Potent CYP2D6 InhibitorsFluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly 
inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive 
metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 
52% decrease in Cmax and a 20% decrease in AUC of 
5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of 
tolterodine [see 
                           CLINICAL 
PHARMACOLOGY (12.1)
                        
                     ]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations 
of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose 
adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see 
                           CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
(12.3)
                        ].
                  
                  
                  
                  7.2 Potent CYP3A4 InhibitorsKetoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased 
the mean Cmax and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, 
respectively in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. 
                  For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as 
itraconazole, clarithromycin or ritonavir, the recommended dose of DETROL LA is 
2 mg once daily [see

                  7.3 Other interactionsNo clinically relevant interactions have been observed when 
tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral 
contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with 
diuretics [see 
                           CLINICAL 
PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)
                        ]
                  
                  
                  
                  7.4 Other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 
Isoenzymes
                     In vivo drug-interaction data show 
that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant 
inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence 
on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [see 
                           CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
(12.3)
                        ].
                  
                  
                  
                  7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test InteractionsInteractions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not 
been studied.
                  
                  
                  7.6 Other AnticholinergicsThe concomitant use of DETROL LA with other anticholinergic 
(antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, 
constipation, blurred vision, somnolence and other anticholienrgic 
pharmacological effects.
