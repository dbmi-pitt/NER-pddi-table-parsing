                        Clinically important interactions may occur when certain drugs are administered concomitantly with aspirin or aspirin-containing drugs.
                        
                           1. Oral Anticoagulants-By interfering with platelet function or decreasing plasma prothrombin concentration, aspirin enhances the potential for bleeding in patients on anticoagulants.
                        2. Methotrexate-aspirin enhances the toxic effects of this drug.
                        3. Probenecid and Sulfinpyrazone-large doses of aspirin reduce the uricosuric effect of both drugs.  Renal excretion of salicylate may also be reduced.
                        4. Oral Antidiabetic Drugs-enhancement of hypoglycemia may occur.
                        5. Antacids-to the extent that they raise urinary pH, antacids may substantially decrease plasma salicylate concentrations; conversely, their withdrawal can result in a substantial increase.
                        6. Ammonium Chloride-this and other drugs that acidify a relatively alkaline urine can elevate plasma salicylate concentrations.
                        7. Ethyl Alcohol-enhanced aspirin-induced fecal blood loss has been reported.
                        8. Corticosteroids-salicylate plasma levels may be decreased when adrenal corticosteroids are given, and may be increased substantially when they are discontinued.
