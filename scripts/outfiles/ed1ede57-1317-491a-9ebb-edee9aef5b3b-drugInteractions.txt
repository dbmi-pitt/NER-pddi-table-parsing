                              Ergotamine tartrate and caffeine should not be administered with other vasoconstrictors.  Use with sympathomimetics (pressor agents) may cause extreme elevation of blood pressure.  The beta-blocker Inderal (propranolol) has been reported to potentiate the vasoconstrictive action of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine by blocking the vasodilating property of epinephrine.  Nicotine may provoke vasoconstriction in some patients, predisposing to a greater ischemic response to ergot therapy.
                              The blood levels of ergotamine-containing drugs are reported to be elevated by the concomitant administration of macrolide antibiotics and vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of the ergotamine-containing drugs when coadministered with these antibiotics.
