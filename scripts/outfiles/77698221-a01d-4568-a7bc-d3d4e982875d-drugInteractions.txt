                        Additives may be incompatible; norepinephrine and dobutamine are incompatible with sodium bicarbonate solution.
The addition of sodium bicarbonate to parenteral solutions containing calcium should be avoided, except where compatibility has been previously established. Precipitation or haze may result from sodium bicarbonate/calcium admixtures. NOTE : Do not use the injection if it contains precipitate.
Additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist, if available. When introducing additives, use aseptic technique, mix thoroughly and do not store.
