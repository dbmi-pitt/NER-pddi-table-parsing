                  Benztropine Mesylate possesses both anticholinergic and 
antihistaminic effects, although only the former have been established as 
therapeutically significant in the management of parkinsonism.
                  In the isolated guinea pig ileum, the anticholinergic activity of this drug 
is about equal to that of atropine; however, when administered orally to 
unanesthetized cats, it is only about half as active as atropine.
                  In laboratory animals, its antihistaminic activity and duration of action 
approach those of pyrilamine maleate.
