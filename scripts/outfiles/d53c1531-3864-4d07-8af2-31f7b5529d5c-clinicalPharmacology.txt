                  Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical
steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
                  Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone),
which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement
therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Synthetic analogs such as triamcinolone
are primarily used for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many
organ systems.
                  Kenalog-40 Injection has an extended duration of effect which may be sustained over a period
of several weeks. Studies indicate that following a single intramuscular dose
of 60 mg to 100 mg of triamcinolone acetonide, adrenal suppression occurs within
24 to 48 hours and then gradually returns to normal, usually in 30 to 40 days.
This finding correlates closely with the extended duration of therapeutic
action achieved with the drug.
