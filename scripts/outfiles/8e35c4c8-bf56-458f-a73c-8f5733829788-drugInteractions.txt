	DRUG INTERACTIONS
               
               
                  No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted. In Trial 1, the proportions of children in the placebo and Synagis groups who received routine childhood vaccines, influenza vaccine, bronchodilators, or corticosteroids were similar and no incremental increase in adverse reactions was observed among children receiving these agents.
