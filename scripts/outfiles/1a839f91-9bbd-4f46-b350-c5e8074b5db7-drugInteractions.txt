                        The following drug interactions may occur with potassium citrate:
                        
                           Potassium-sparing diuretics: concomitant administration should be avoided since the simultaneous administration of these agents can produce severe hyperkalemia (7.1)
                           
                           Drugs that slow gastrointestinal transit time: These agents (such as anticholinergics) can be expected to increase the gastrointestinal irritation produced by potassium salts (7.2) 
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.1 Potential Effects of Potassium citrate on Other Drugs
                     
                        
                           Potassium-sparing Diuretics: Concomitant administration of potassium citrate and a potassium-sparing diuretic (such as triamterene, spironolactone or amiloride) should be avoided since the simultaneous administration of these agents can produce severe hyperkalemia. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.2 Potential Effects of Other Drugs on Potassium citrate
                     
                        
                           Drugs that slow gastrointestinal transit time: These agents (such as anticholinergics) can be expected to increase the gastrointestinal irritation produced by potassium salts.
