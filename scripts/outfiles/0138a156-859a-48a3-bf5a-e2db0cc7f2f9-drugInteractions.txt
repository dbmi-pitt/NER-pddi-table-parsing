                        It has been reported that BACTRIM may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin. This interaction should be kept in mind when BACTRIM is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed.
                        BACTRIM may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin. BACTRIM, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect.
                        Sulfonamides can also displace methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites and can compete with the renal transport of methotrexate, thus increasing free methotrexate concentrations.
                        There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with coadministration of BACTRIM and cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients.
                        Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored.
                        Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving indomethacin. 
                        Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop megaloblastic anemia if BACTRIM is prescribed.
                        The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants can decrease when coadministered with BACTRIM.
                        Like other sulfonamide-containing drugs, BACTRIM potentiates the effect of oral hypoglycemics.
                        In the literature, a single case of toxic delirium has been reported after concomitant intake of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and amantadine.
                        In the literature, three cases of hyperkalemia in elderly patients have been reported after concomitant intake of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.10,11
