                              CNS Depressants
                           
                        
                        Promethazine HCl Injection may increase, prolong, or intensify the sedative action of central-nervous-system depressants, such as alcohol, sedative/hypnotics (including barbiturates), general anesthetics, narcotics, narcotic analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients receiving promethazine HCl. When given concomitantly with Promethazine HCl Injection, the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one-half, and the dose of narcotics should be reduced by one-quarter to one-half. Dosage must be individualized. Excessive amounts of Promethazine HCl Injection relative to a narcotic may lead to restlessness and motor hyperactivity in the patient with pain; these symptoms usually disappear with adequate control of the pain.
                        
                           
                              Epinephrine
                           
                        
                        Because of the potential for promethazine HCl to reverse epinephrine’s vasopressor effect, epinephrine should NOT be used to treat hypotension associated with Promethazine HCl Injection overdose.
                        
                           
                              Anticholinergics
                           
                        
                        Concomitant use of other agents with anticholinergic properties should be undertaken with caution.
                        
                           
                              Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors
                           
                        
                        Drug interactions, including an increased incidence of extrapyramidal effects, have been reported when some MAO Inhibitors and phenothiazines are used concomitantly. This possibility should be considered with Promethazine HCl Injection.
