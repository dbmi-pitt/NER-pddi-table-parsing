                        Cannabinoids, barbiturates, opiates, and alcohol may have additive effects with trihexyphenidyl HCl, and thus, an abuse potential exists. 
                        Concurrent use of alcohol or other CNS depressants with trihexyphenidyl HCl may cause increased sedative effects. 
                        Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants possessing significant anticholinergic activity may intensify the anticholinergic effects of antidyskinetic agents because of the secondary anticholinergic activities of these medications. 
                        Prophylactic administration of anticholinergic agents, such as trihexyphenidyl, as a prevention of drug-induced parkinsonism during neuroleptic therapy is not recommended. There may be an increased risk for the development of tardive dyskinesia during concomitant administration of anticholinergics and neuroleptics (see 
                              PRECAUTIONS, General).  
                        The usual dose of either trihexyphenidyl or levodopa may need to be reduced during concomitant therapy, since concomitant administration may increase drug-induced involuntary movements (see 
                              DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
