                              KAZANO combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary and distinct mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: alogliptin, a selective inhibitor of DPP-4, and metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Alogliptin
                              
                              Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Alogliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin selectively binds to and inhibits DPP-4 but not DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures.

                              Metformin is a biguanide that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes or in healthy subjects except in special circumstances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and daylong plasma insulin response may actually decrease.

                                 Alogliptin
                              
                              Single-dose administration of alogliptin to healthy subjects resulted in a peak inhibition of DPP-4 within two to three hours after dosing. The peak inhibition of DPP-4 exceeded 93% across doses of 12.5 mg to 800 mg. Inhibition of DPP-4 remained above 80% at 24 hours for doses greater than or equal to 25 mg. Peak and total exposure over 24 hours to active GLP-1 were three- to four-fold greater with alogliptin (at doses of 25 to 200 mg) than placebo. In a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, alogliptin 25 mg demonstrated decreases in postprandial glucagon while increasing postprandial active GLP-1 levels compared to placebo over an eight-hour period following a standardized meal. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in overall glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, alogliptin 25 mg demonstrated decreases in two-hour postprandial glucose compared to placebo (-30 mg/dL versus 17 mg/dL, respectively).
                              Multiple-dose administration of alogliptin to patients with type 2 diabetes also resulted in a peak inhibition of DPP-4 within one to two hours and exceeded 93% across all doses (25 mg, 100 mg and 400 mg) after a single dose and after 14 days of once-daily dosing. At these doses of alogliptin, inhibition of DPP-4 remained above 81% at 24 hours after 14 days of dosing.

                                    In bioequivalence studies of KAZANO, the area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) of both the alogliptin and the metformin component following a single dose of the combination tablet were bioequivalent to the alogliptin 12.5 mg concomitantly administered with metformin HCl 500 or 1000 mg tablets under fasted conditions in healthy subjects. Administration of KAZANO with food resulted in no change in total exposure (AUC) of alogliptin and metformin. Mean peak plasma concentrations of alogliptin and metformin were decreased by 13% and 28%, respectively, when administered with food. There was no change in time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) for alogliptin under fed conditions, however, there was a delayed Tmax for metformin of 1.5 hours. These changes are not likely to be clinically significant.

                                    The absolute bioavailability of alogliptin is approximately 100%. Administration of alogliptin with a high-fat meal resulted in no change in total and peak exposure to alogliptin. Alogliptin may therefore be administered with or without food.

                                    The absolute bioavailability of metformin following administration of a 500 mg metformin HCl tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1500 mg and 850 mg to 2550 mg indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin HCl with food compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.

Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally less than 1 mcg/mL. During controlled clinical trials, which served as the basis for approval for metformin, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 mcg/mL, even at maximum doses.

                                    Alogliptin does not undergo extensive metabolism and 60% to 71% of the dose is excreted as unchanged drug in the urine.
                                    Two minor metabolites were detected following administration of an oral dose of [14C] alogliptin, N-demethylated, M-I (less than 1% of the parent compound), and N-acetylated alogliptin, M-II (less than 6% of the parent compound). M-I is an active metabolite and is an inhibitor of DPP-4 similar to the parent molecule; M-II does not display any inhibitory activity toward DPP-4 or other DPP-related enzymes. In vitro data indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 contribute to the limited metabolism of alogliptin.
                                    Alogliptin exists predominantly as the (R)-enantiomer (more than 99%) and undergoes little or no chiral conversion in vivo to the (S)-enantiomer. The (S)-enantiomer is not detectable at the 25 mg dose.

                                    Intravenous single-dose studies in healthy subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion.

                                    The primary route of elimination of [14C] alogliptin-derived radioactivity occurred via renal excretion (76%) with 13% recovered in the feces, achieving a total recovery of 89% of the administered radioactive dose. The renal clearance of alogliptin (9.6 L/hr) indicates some active renal tubular secretion and systemic clearance was 14.0 L/hr.

                                    Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.

                                          Use of KAZANO in patients with renal impairment increases the risk for lactic acidosis. Because KAZANO contains metformin, KAZANO is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

                                          KAZANO is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. KAZANO contains metformin and use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

                                          Total exposure to alogliptin was approximately 10% lower and peak exposure was approximately 8% lower in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Grade B) compared to healthy subjects. The magnitude of these reductions is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Grade C) have not been studied.

                                          KAZANO contains metformin, which is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Due to declining renal function in the elderly, measurement of creatinine clearance should be obtained prior to initiation of therapy. Do not use KAZANO if renal function is not within normal range.

                                          Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmax is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function.
