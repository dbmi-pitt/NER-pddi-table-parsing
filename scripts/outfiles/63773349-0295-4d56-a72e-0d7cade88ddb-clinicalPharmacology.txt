                  The mechanism(s) by which azelaic acid interferes with the pathogenic events in rosacea are unknown.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics:
                     
                        The percutaneous absorption of azelaic acid after topical application of FINACEA Gel, 15%, could not be reliably determined. Mean plasma azelaic acid concentrations in rosacea patients treated with FINACEA Gel, 15%, twice daily for at least 8 weeks are in the range of 42 to 63.1 ng/mL. These values are within the maximum concentration range of 24.0 to 90.5 ng/mL observed in rosacea patients treated with vehicle only. This indicates that FINACEA Gel, 15%, does not increase plasma azelaic acid concentration beyond the range derived from nutrition and endogenous metabolism.
                        
                           In vitro and human data suggest negligible cutaneous metabolism of 3H-azelaic acid 20% cream after topical application. Azelaic acid is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine, but undergoes some ß-oxidation to shorter chain dicarboxylic acids.
