                  Methylene Blue will produce two opposite actions on hemoglobin.  Low concentrations will convert methemoglobin to hemoglobin.  High concentrations convert the ferrous iron of reduced hemoglobin to ferric iron which results in the formation of methemoglobin.
                  Methylene blue is metabolized in the body to leukomethylene blue which is excreted primarily in the urine..Some unchaged drug is also excreted in the urine. (1)
