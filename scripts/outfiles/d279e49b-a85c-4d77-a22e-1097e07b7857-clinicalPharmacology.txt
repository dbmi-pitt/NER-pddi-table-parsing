                  Studies in healthy volunteers show that in single high doses 
lorazepam has a tranquilizing action on the central nervous system with no 
appreciable effect on the respiratory or cardiovascular systems.
                  Lorazepam is readily absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 90 percent. 
Peak concentrations in plasma occur approximately 2 hours following 
administration. The peak plasma level of lorazepam from a 2 mg dose is 
approximately 20 ng/ml.
                  The mean half-life of unconjugated lorazepam in human plasma is about 12 
hours and for its major metabolite, lorazepam glucuronide, about 18 hours. At 
clinically relevant concentrations, lorazepam is approximately 85% bound to 
plasma proteins. Lorazepam is rapidly conjugated at its 3-hydroxy group into 
lorazepam glucuronide which is then excreted in the urine. Lorazepam glucuronide 
has no demonstrable CNS activity in animals.
                  The plasma levels of lorazepam are proportional to the dose given. There is 
no evidence of accumulation of lorazepam on administration up to six months.
                  Studies comparing young and elderly subjects have shown that the 
pharmacokinetics of lorazepam remain unaltered with advancing age.
