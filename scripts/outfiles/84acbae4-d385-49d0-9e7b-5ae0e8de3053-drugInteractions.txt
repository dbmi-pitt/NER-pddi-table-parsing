                        Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
                        Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin.
                        The concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.
                        Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective.
                        Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (See 
                              PRECAUTIONS
                           ).
                        Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines.
                        MINOCIN® (minocycline) for Injection contains magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (See 
                              DESCRIPTION
                           ). Potentially serious drug interactions may occur when intravenous magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is given concomitantly with CNS depressants, neuromuscular blocking agents and cardiac glycosides.
