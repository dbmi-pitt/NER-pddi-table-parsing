                  Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets and methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used in patients being treated (currently or within the proceeding two weeks) with MAO Inhibitors (see

                     , Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors). Because of possible effects on blood pressure, methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets and methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be used cautiously with pressor agents.
                  Methylphenidate may decrease the effectiveness of drugs used to treat hypertension. Methylphenidate is metabolized primarily to ritalinic acid by de-esterification and not through oxidative pathways.
                  Human pharmacologic studies have shown that racemic methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone), and tricyclic drugs (e.g., imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine). Downward dose adjustments of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with methylphenidate. It may be necessary to adjust the dosage and monitor plasma drug concentration (or, in case of coumarin, coagulation times), when initiating or discontinuing methylphenidate.
