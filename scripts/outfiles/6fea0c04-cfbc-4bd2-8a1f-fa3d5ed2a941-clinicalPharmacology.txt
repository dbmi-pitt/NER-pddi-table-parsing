                  1. Mode of ActionORTHO MICRONOR® progestin-only oral 
contraceptives prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in approximately half 
of users, thickening the cervical mucus to inhibit sperm penetration, lowering 
the midcycle LH and FSH peaks, slowing the movement of the ovum through the 
fallopian tubes, and altering the endometrium.
                  
                  2. PharmacokineticsSerum progestin levels peak about two hours after oral 
administration, followed by rapid distribution and elimination. By 24 hours 
after drug ingestion, serum levels are near baseline, making efficacy dependent 
upon rigid adherence to the dosing schedule. There are large variations in serum 
levels among individual users. Progestin-only administration results in lower 
steady-state serum progestin levels and a shorter elimination half-life than 
concomitant administration with estrogens.
