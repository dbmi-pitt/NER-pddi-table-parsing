                  Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical
steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
                  Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone),
which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy
in adrenocortical deficiency states. Synthetic analogs such as triamcinolone
are primarily used for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many
organ systems.
