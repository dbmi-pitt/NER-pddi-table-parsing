                  DRUG INTERACTIONS
               
               
                  Colchicine and androgen-deprivation therapeutic drugs have been reported to interfere with choline-based PET imaging [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
                  The impact of androgen-deprivation therapeutic drugs upon 11C-choline PET imaging may depend upon the hormonal responsiveness of a patient’s recurrent prostate cancer.  Clinical studies have not established this relationship but published reports suggest 11C-choline PET imaging may be productive in patients with “hormone resistant” recurrent prostate cancer even if the patients are receiving anti-androgen therapy.  Imaging may prove unproductive or misleading due to failed or insufficient 11C-choline uptake in patients with hormone-responsive cancer if the patients are receiving androgen-deprivation therapy.  
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        Colchicine and androgen-deprivation therapeutic drugs may interfere with 11C-choline PET/CT imaging performance (5.1).
