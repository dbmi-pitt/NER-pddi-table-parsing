                        Acetazolamide modifies phenytoin metabolism with increased serum levels of phenytoin. This may increase or enhance the occurrence of osteomalacia in some patients receiving chronic phenytoin therapy. Caution is advised in patients receiving chronic concomitant therapy. By decreasing the gastrointestinal absorption of primidone, acetazolamide may decrease serum concentrations of primidone and its metabolites, with a consequent possible decrease in anticonvulsant effect. Caution is advised when beginning, discontinuing, or changing the dose of acetazolamide in patients receiving primidone. 
                        Because of possible additive effects with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, concomitant use is not advisable. 
                        Acetazolamide may increase the effects of other folic acid antagonists. 
                        Acetazolamide decreases urinary excretion of amphetamine and may enhance the magnitude and duration of their effect. 
                        Acetazolamide reduces urinary excretion of quinidine and may enhance its effect. 
                        Acetazolamide may prevent the urinary antiseptic effect of methenamine. 
                        Acetazolamide increases lithium excretion and the lithium may be decreased.
                        Acetazolamide and sodium bicarbonate used concurrently increase the risk of renal calculus formation.
                        Acetazolamide may elevate cyclosporine levels.
