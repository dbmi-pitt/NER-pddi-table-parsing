                  1.5% Glycine Irrigation USP is nontoxic, nonhemolytic, not sticky, and has a refractive index close to that of water. These properties make it useful as a urologic irrigating fluid, particularly during transurethral surgical procedures where the irrigant may be absorbed through cut venous sinuses.
                  Systemically absorbed glycine is primarily metabolized by transamination to serine, and by deamination to ammonia which is normally removed by its conversion to urea. A portion of the absorbed glycine is excreted by the kidneys.
