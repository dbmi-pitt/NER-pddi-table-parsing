                        Opioid analgesics may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking
                                    action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increase in
                                    the degree of respiratory depression. 
                        Patients receiving CNS depressants such as other opioid
                                    analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other
                                    tranquilizers, centrally-acting anti-emetics, sedative-hypnotics
                                    or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with
                                    ENDODAN tablets may exhibit an additive CNS depression. When
                                    such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both
                                    agents should be reduced.
                        Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine,
                                    nalbuphine, naltrexone, and butorphanol) should be administered
                                    with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a
                                    pure opioid agonist such as oxycodone. These agonist/antagonist
                                    analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxycodone or may
                                    precipitate withdrawal symptoms.
