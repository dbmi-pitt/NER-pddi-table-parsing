                              The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with combined gemfibrozil and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy. Myopathy or rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure have been reported as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy or after several months (see WARNINGS). There is no assurance that periodic monitoring of creatine kinase will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy and kidney damage.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Anticoagulants
                           
                              CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN ANTICOAGULANTS ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH GEMFIBROZIL. THE DOSAGE OF THE ANTICOAGULANT SHOULD BE REDUCED TO MAINTAIN THE PROTHROMBIN TIME AT THE DESIRED LEVEL TO PREVENT BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS. FREQUENT PROTHROMBIN DETERMINATIONS ARE ADVISABLE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY DETERMINED THAT THE PROTHROMBIN LEVEL HAS STABILIZED.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Repaglinide
                           
                              In healthy volunteers, coadministration with gemfibrozil increased the plasma concentration of repaglinide and prolonged its hypoglycemic effects.  Coadministration of gemfibrozil and repaglinide increases the risk for severe hypoglycemia and is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
