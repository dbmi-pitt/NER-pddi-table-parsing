                               Ergot-type or ergotamine-containing medications other 5HT1 agonists, and ZOMIG: do not use within 24 hours of each other (4.5, 7.1, 7.3)
                           
                               Do not use ZOMIG within 2 weeks of an MAO-A inhibitor (4.7, 7.2)
                           
                               Cimetidine: half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan doubled (7.4)
                           
                               SSRI or SNRI: life-threatening serotonin syndrome reported during combined use with triptans (5.5, 7.5)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Ergot-containing drugs
                     
                        Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided  [see Contraindications (4.5)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors
                     
                        MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) and Contraindications (4.7)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists (e.g. triptans)
                     
                        Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists within 24 hours of ZOMIG treatment is not recommended  [see Contraindications (4.5)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Cimetidine
                     
                        Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan and its active metabolites were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome
                     
                        Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and triptans  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].
