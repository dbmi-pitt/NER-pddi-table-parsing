                        Severe hypertension has been reported when oxytocin was
                                    given three to four hours following prophylactic administration
                                    of a vasoconstrictor in conjunction with caudal-block
                                    anesthesia. Cyclopropane anesthesia may modify oxytocin’s
                                    cardiovascular effects, so as to produce unexpected results such
                                    as hypotension. Maternal sinus bradycardia with abnormal
                                    atrioventricular rhythms has also been noted when oxytocin was
                                    used concomitantly with cyclopropane anesthesia.
