                        Although BETAGAN
                           ® ophthalmic solution
                                    used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis
                                    resulting from concomitant therapy with
                                    BETAGAN
                           ® and epinephrine may occur. 
                        Close observation of the patient is recommended when a
                                    beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving
                                    catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of
                                    possible additive effects and the production of hypotension
                                    and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope,
                                    or postural hypotension. 
                        Patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents along
                                    with either oral or intravenous calcium antagonists should be
                                    monitored for possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances,
                                    left ventricular failure and hypotension. In patients with
                                    impaired cardiac function, simultaneous use should be avoided
                                    altogether. 
                        The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents
                                    with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects
                                    on prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 
                        Phenothiazine-related compounds and beta-adrenergic
                                    blocking agents may have additive hypotensive effects due to the
                                    inhibition of each other's metabolism.
