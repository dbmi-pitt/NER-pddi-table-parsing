                     7.1 Bile Acid Sequestering Agents 
                     
                        Bile acid sequestering agents such as cholestyramine and colestipol may interfere with the action of ursodiol by reducing its absorption. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Aluminum-based Antacids 
                     
                        Aluminum-based antacids have been shown to adsorb bile acids in vitro and may be expected to interfere with ursodiol in the same manner as the bile acid sequestering agents. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Drugs Affecting Lipid Metabolism
                     
                        Estrogens, oral contraceptives, and clofibrate (and perhaps other lipid-lowering drugs) increase hepatic cholesterol secretion and encourage cholesterol gallstone formation and hence may counteract the effectiveness of ursodiol.
