                  The drug interaction of calcium acetate is characterized by the potential of calcium to bind to drugs with anionic functions (e.g., carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups). Calcium acetate may decrease the bioavailability of tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones via this mechanism.
                  There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between calcium acetate and most concomitant drugs. When administering an oral medication with calcium acetate where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its
                  safety or efficacy, administer the drug one hour before or three hours after calcium acetate. Monitor blood levels of the concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.
                  Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medications for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure medications for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from the clinical trials with all forms of calcium acetate.
                  
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Calcium acetate may decrease the bioavailability of tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones. (7)
                           When clinically significant drug interactions are expected, administer the drug at least one hour before or at least three hours after calcium acetate or consider monitoring blood levels of the drug.

                       7.1 Ciprofloxacin

                     
                        In a study of 15 healthy subjects, a co-administered single dose of 4 calcium acetate tablets, approximately 2.7 g, decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50%.
