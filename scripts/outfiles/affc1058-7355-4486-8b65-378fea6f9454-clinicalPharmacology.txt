                     Mechanism of Action
                  
                  Treatment of genital warts with podofilox results in necrosis of visible wart tissue. The exact mechanism of action is unknown.
                  
                     Pharmacokinetics
                  
                  In systemic absorption studies in 52 patients, topical application of 0.05 mL of 0.5% podofilox solution to external genitalia did not result in detectable serum levels. Applications of 0.1 to 1.5 mL resulted in peak serum levels of 1 to 17 ng/mL 1 to 2 hours after application. The elimination half-life ranged from 1 to 4.5 hours. The drug was not found to accumulate after multiple treatments.
