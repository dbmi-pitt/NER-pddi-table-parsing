                        Patients receiving narcotics, antihistaminics, antipsychotics, antianxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with hydrocodone polistirex and chlorpheniramine polistirex ER oral suspension may exhibit an additive CNS depression. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.  
                        The use of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone.  
                        The concurrent use of other anticholinergics with hydrocodone may produce paralytic ileus.
