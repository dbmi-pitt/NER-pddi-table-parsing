                        The concomitant use of terbutaline sulfate with other sympathomimetic agents is not recommended, since the combined effect on the cardiovascular system may be deleterious to the patient. However, this does not preclude the use of an aerosol bronchodilator of the adrenergic-stimulant type for the relief of an acute bronchospasm in patients receiving chronic oral therapy with terbutaline sulfate.
