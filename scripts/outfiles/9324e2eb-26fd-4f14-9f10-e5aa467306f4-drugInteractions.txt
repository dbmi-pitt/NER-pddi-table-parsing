                  Other short-acting sympathomimetic bronchodilators should not be used concomitantly with PROAIR RESPICLICK. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.

                              •Beta-blockers: May decrease effectiveness of PROAIR RESPICLICK and produce severe bronchospasm. Patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. (7.1)
                           
                              •Diuretics, or non-potassium sparing diuretics: May potentiate hypokalemia or ECG changes.  Consider monitoring potassium levels. (7.2)
                           
                              •Digoxin: May decrease serum digoxin levels. Consider monitoring digoxin levels. (7.3)
                           
                              •Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: May potentiate effect of albuterol on the cardiovascular system.

                     7.1  Beta Blockers
                     
                        Beta-adrenergic-receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as PROAIR RESPICLICK, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, eg, as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic-blocking agents in patients with asthma.  In this setting, consider cardioselective beta-blockers, although they should be administered with caution.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2  Diuretics
                     
                        The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia which may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with non-potassium sparing diuretics.  Consider monitoring potassium levels.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3  Digoxin
                     
                        Mean decreases of 16% and 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving albuterol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and PROAIR RESPICLICK.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants
                     
                        PROAIR RESPICLICK should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated. Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.
