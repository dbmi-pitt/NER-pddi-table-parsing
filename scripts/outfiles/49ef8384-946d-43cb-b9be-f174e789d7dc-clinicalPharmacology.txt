                  Chlorthalidone is an oral diuretic with prolonged action (48–72 
hours) and low toxicity. The major portion of the drug is excreted unchanged by 
the kidneys. The diuretic effect of the drug occurs in approximately 2.6 hours 
and continues for up to 72 hours. The mean half-life following a 50 to 200 mg 
dose is 40 hours. In the first order of absorption, the elimination half-life is 
53 hours following a 50 mg dose, and 60 hours following a 100 mg dose. 
Approximately 75 percent of the drug is bound to plasma proteins, 58 percent of 
the drug being bound to albumin. This is caused by an increased affinity of the 
drug to erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase. Nonrenal routes of elimination have yet 
to be clarified. Data are not available regarding percentage of dose as 
unchanged drug and metabolites, concentration of the drug in body fluids, degree 
of uptake by a particular organ or in the fetus, or passage across the 
blood-brain barrier.
                  The drug produces copious diuresis with greatly increased excretion of sodium 
and chloride. At maximal therapeutic dosage, chlorthalidone is approximately 
equal in its diuretic effect to comparable maximal therapeutic doses of 
benzothiadiazine diuretics. The site of action appears to be the cortical 
diluting segment of the ascending limb of Henle's loop of the nephron.
