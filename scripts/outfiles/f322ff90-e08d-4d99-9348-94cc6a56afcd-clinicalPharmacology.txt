                     MECHANISM OF ACTION
                     
                        
                           Mechanism of Action: Digoxin inhibits 
sodium-potassium ATPase, an enzyme that regulates the quantity of sodium and 
potassium inside cells. Inhibition of the enzyme leads to an increase in the 
intracellular concentration of sodium and thus (by stimulation of sodium-calcium 
exchange) an increase in the intracellular concentration of calcium. The 
beneficial effects of digoxin result from direct actions on cardiac muscle, as 
well as indirect actions on the cardiovascular system mediated by effects on the 
autonomic nervous system. The autonomic effects include: (1) a vagomimetic 
action, which is responsible for the effects of digoxin on the sinoatrial and 
atrioventricular (AV) nodes; and (2) baroreceptor sensitization, which results 
in increased afferent inhibitory activity and reduced activity of the 
sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system for any given increment 
in mean arterial pressure. The pharmacologic consequences of these direct and 
indirect effects are: (1) an increase in the force and velocity of myocardial 
systolic contraction (positive inotropic action); (2) a decrease in the degree 
of activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system 
(neurohormonal deactivating effect); and (3) slowing of the heart rate and 
decreased conduction velocity through the AV node (vagomimetic effect). The 
effects of digoxin in heart failure are mediated by its positive inotropic and 
neu-rohormonal deactivating effects, whereas the effects of the drug in atrial 
arrhythmias are related to its vagomimetic actions. In high doses, digoxin 
increases sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS). This 
increase in sympathetic activity may be an important factor in digitalis 
toxicity.
