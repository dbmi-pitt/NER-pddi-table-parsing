                        Caution should be taken in concurrent or serial use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrtoxic drugs because of possible enhancement of the nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity of neomycin (see 
                           
                              boxed WARNINGS
                           ).
                        Caution should also be taken in concurrent or serial use of other aminoglycosides and polymyxins because they may enhance neomycin's nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity and potentiate neomycin sulfate's neuromuscular blocking effects.
                        Oral neomycin inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of penicillin V, oral vitamin B-12, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil. The gastrointestinal absorption of digoxin also appears to be inhibited. Therefore, digoxin serum levels should be monitored.
                        Oral neomycin sulfate may enhance the effect of coumarin in anticoagulants by decreasing vitamin K availability.
