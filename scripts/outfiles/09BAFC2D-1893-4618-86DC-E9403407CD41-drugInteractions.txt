Drug interactions
Androgens may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. Dosage of the anticoagulant
may require reduction in order to maintain satisfactory therapeutic hypoprothrombinemia.Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone.In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and, therefore, insulin requirements.
