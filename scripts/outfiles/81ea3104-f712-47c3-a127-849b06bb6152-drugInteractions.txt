                        Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see 
                                 Drug Interactions (7.1)
                               and 
                                 Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
                           
                           . Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see 
                                 Drug Interactions (7.1)
                               and 
                                 Clinical Pharmacology (12.3
                              
                              )].
                        Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see 
                                 Drug Interactions (7.1)
                               and 
                                 Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
                           
                           .
                        
                        Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see 
                                 Drug Interactions (7.2
                              
                              ) and 
                                 Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
                           
                           .
                        
                        Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see 
                                 Drug Interactions (7.3

                        Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see 
                                 Drug Interactions (7.4)
