                     12.1 Mechanism of Action 
                     
                        The mechanism(s) by which azelaic acid interferes with the pathogenic events in rosacea are unknown.

                        The pharmacodynamics of azelaic acid in association with the treatment of rosacea are unknown.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics 
                     
                        The percutaneous absorption of azelaic acid after topical application of Azelaic Acid Gel could not be reliably determined. Mean plasma azelaic acid concentrations in rosacea subjects treated with Azelaic Acid Gel twice daily for at least 8 weeks are in the range of 42 to 63.1 ng/mL. These values are within the maximum concentration range of 24.0 to 90.5 ng/mL observed in rosacea subjects treated with vehicle only. This indicates that Azelaic Acid Gel does not increase plasma azelaic acid concentration beyond the range derived from nutrition and endogenous metabolism.
                        
                           In vitro and human data suggest negligible cutaneous metabolism of 3H-azelaic acid after topical application of 20% azelaic acid cream. Azelaic acid is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine, but undergoes some ß-oxidation to shorter chain dicarboxylic acids.
