When Ciprofloxacin Tablets USP, 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg is given concomitantly with food, there is a delay in the absorption of the drug, resulting in peak concentrations that occur closer to 2 hours after dosing rather than 1 hour. The overall absorption of Ciprofloxacin Tablets USP, 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg however, is not substantially affected. Concurrent administration of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide may reduce the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by as much as 90%. (See

The serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were not altered when these two drugs were given concomitantly.
 
Concomitant administration with tizanidine is contraindicated. (See

Concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin with theophylline decreases the clearance of theophylline resulting in elevated serum theophylline levels and increased risk of a patient developing CNS or other adverse reactions. Ciprofloxacin also decreases caffeine clearance and inhibits the formation of paraxanthine after caffeine administration. (See
