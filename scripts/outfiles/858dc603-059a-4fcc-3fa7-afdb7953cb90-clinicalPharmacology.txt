                  When administered intravenously, these solutions provide a source of water and carbohydrate.
                  Isotonic and hypertonic concentrations of dextrose are suitable for parenteral maintenance of water requirements when salt is not needed or should be avoided.
                  Solutions containing carbohydrate in the form of dextrose restore blood glucose levels and provide calories. Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may aid in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein-sparing action. Dextrose injected parenterally undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide and water.
                  Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately

    70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirements range from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).
                  Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.
