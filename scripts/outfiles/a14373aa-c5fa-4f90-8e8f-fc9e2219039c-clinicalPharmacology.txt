                  Polymyxin B sulfate has a bactericidal action against almost all gram-negative bacilli except the Proteus group. Polymyxins increase the permeability of bacterial cell wall membranes. All gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and the gram-negative cocci, N gonorrhoeae and N meningitidis, are resistant. 
                  Polymyxin B has bactericidal action against almost all Gram-negative bacilli except the Proteus group. Polymyxins increase the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane leading to death of the cell. All Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and Gram-negative cocci, are resistant to polymyxin B. Appropriate methods should be used when performing in vitro susceptibility testing of polymyxin B (1,2,3). The following in vitro susceptibility test criteria should only be used for interpreting the results of polymyxin B susceptibility testing against P. aeruginosa when the indicated quality control parameters are met during testing. 
                  



                  


Polymyxin B sulfate is not absorbed from the normal alimentary tract. Since the drug loses 50 percent of its activity in the presence of serum, active blood levels are low. Repeated injections may give a cumulative effect. Levels tend to be higher in infants and children. The drug is excreted slowly by the kidneys. Tissue diffusion is poor and the drug does not pass the blood brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid. In therapeutic dosage, polymyxin B sulfate causes some nephrotoxicity with tubule damage to a slight degree.
