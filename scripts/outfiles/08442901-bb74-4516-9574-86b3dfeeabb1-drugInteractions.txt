                        This drug should not be used with the following medications because very serious interactions may occur: sodium oxybate.
                        Avoid MAO inhibitors (isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, rasagiline, selegiline, or tranylcypromine) within 2 weeks before, during, and after treatment with this medication. In some cases a serious (possibly fatal) drug interaction may occur.
                        Consider drugs that cause drowsiness such as: certain antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine), anti-seizure drugs (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin), medicine for sleep or anxiety (e.g., alprazolam, diazepam, zolpidem), muscle relaxants (e.g., cyclobenzaprine), narcotic pain relievers (e.g., codeine), psychiatric medicines (e.g., chlorpromazine, risperidone, trazodone).
                        This medication may interfere with certain laboratory tests (including certain urine glucose tests, urine catecholamine levels, urine 5-HIAA levels), possibly causing false test results.
