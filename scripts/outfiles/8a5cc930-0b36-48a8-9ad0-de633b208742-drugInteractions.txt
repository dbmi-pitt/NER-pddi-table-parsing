                        Since ethosuximide may interact with concurrently administered antiepileptic drugs, periodic serum level determinations of these drugs may be necessary (e.g., ethosuximide may elevate phenytoin serum levels, and valproic acid has been reported to both increase and decrease ethosuximide levels).
