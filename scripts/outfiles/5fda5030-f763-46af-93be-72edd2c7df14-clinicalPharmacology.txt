                  Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) retain phosphorus and can develop hyperphosphatemia.  When the product of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations (Ca × P) exceeds 55 mg2/dL2, there is an increased risk that ectopic calcification will occur.  Hyperphosphatemia plays a role in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal insufficiency.
                  Treatment of hyperphosphatemia includes reduction in dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of intestinal phosphate absorption with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate with dialysis.  Sevelamer carbonate taken with meals has been shown to control serum phosphorus concentrations in patients with CKD who are on dialysis.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Sevelamer carbonate tablets and powder contain sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and calcium.  It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone.  These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding.  By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum (serum phosphorus).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        In addition to effects on serum phosphorus levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models.  Bile acid binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol.  Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat soluble vitamins such as A, D and K.  In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15–31%.  This effect is observed after 2 weeks.  Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change.

                        A mass balance study using 14C-sevelamer hydrochloride, in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed.  No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease.
