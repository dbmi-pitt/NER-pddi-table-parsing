                        Methazolamide should be used with caution in patients on steroid therapy because of the potential for developing hypokalemia.
                        Caution is advised for patients receiving high-dose aspirin and methazolamide concomitantly, as anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy, coma and death have been reported with concomitant use of high-dose aspirin and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (see WARNINGS).
