However, the systemic administration of some quinolones has been shown to elevate plasma concentrations of theophylline, interfere with the metabolism of caffeine, and enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant  warfarin  and  its  derivatives,  and  has  been  associated  with  transient elevations  in  serum  creatinine  in  patients  receiving  cyclosporine  concomitantly.
