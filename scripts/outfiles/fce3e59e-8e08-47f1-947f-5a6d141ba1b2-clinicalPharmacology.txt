                  The mechanisms by which metronidazole acts in the treatment of rosacea are unknown, but appear to include an anti-inflammatory effect.

                        Absorption of metronidazole after topical application of Metronidazole Topical Lotion is less complete and more prolonged than after oral administration. Detectable plasma levels were found in all subjects following the administration of a 1 gram dose of Metronidazole Topical Lotion (containing 7.5 mg of metronidazole) applied every morning and evening for 4 days to the faces of 8 patients. The highest concentration (96 ng/mL) seen following the morning dose on Day 5 was approximately 80 times lower than the peak concentrations produced by a single 250 mg tablet of metronidazole. The mean (± SD) AUC0-24 after twice daily administration was 962 ± 373 ng.hr/mL.
