                  Griseofulvin Oral Suspension acts systemically to inhibit the 
growth of Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton genera of fungi. Fungistatic amounts are 
deposited in the keratin, which is gradually exfoliated and replaced by 
noninfected tissue. 
                  Griseofulvin absorption from the gastrointestinal tract varies considerably 
among individuals, mainly because of insolubility of the drug in aqueous media 
of the upper G.I. tract. The peak serum level found in fasting adults given 0.5 
gm occurs at about four hours and ranges between 0.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL.
                  It should be noted that some individuals are consistently "poor absorbers" 
and tend to attain lower blood levels at all times. This may explain 
unsatisfactory therapeutic results in some patients. Better blood levels can 
probably be attained in most patients if administered after a meal with a high 
fat content.
