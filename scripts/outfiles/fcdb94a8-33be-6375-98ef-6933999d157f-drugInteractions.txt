                  Significant drug interactions with Lamotrigine are summarized in Table 13. Additional details of these drug interaction studies are provided in the Clinical Pharmacology section [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                   
                  


                  


↓ = Decreased (induces Lamotrigine glucuronidation).
                  ↑ = Increased (inhibits Lamotrigine glucuronidation).
                  ? = Conflicting data.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Valproate increases Lamotrigine concentrations more than 2-fold. (7, 12.3)  
                           Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, and rifampin decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 40%. (7, 12.3)  
                           Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 50%.. (7, 12.3) 
                           Protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/lopinavir decrease lamotrigine exposure by approximately 50% and 32%, respectively. (7, 12.3)
