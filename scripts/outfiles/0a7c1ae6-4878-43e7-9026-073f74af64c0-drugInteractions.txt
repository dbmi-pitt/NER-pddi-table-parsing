                           Bile Acid Sequestering Agents: May interfere with the action of ursodiol tablets, USP 250 mg and 500 mg by reducing its absorption (7.1)
                           Aluminum-based Antacids: May interfere with the action of ursodiol tablets, USP 250 mg and 500 mg by reducing its absorption (7.2)
                           Drugs that alter the metabolism of lipids or induce cholestasis may interfere with the action of ursodiol tablets, USP 250 mg and 500 mg (7.3)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.1 Bile Acid Sequestering Agents
                     
                     
                         Bile acid sequestering agents such as cholestyramine and colestipol may interfere with the action of ursodiol tablets, USP 250 mg and 500 mg by reducing its absorption.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.2 Aluminum-based Antacids
                     
                     
                        Aluminum-based antacids have been shown to adsorb bile acids in vitro and may be expected to interfere with ursodiol tablets, USP 250 mg and 500 mg in the same manner as the bile acid sequestering agents. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     
                        7.3 Drugs Affecting Lipid Metabolism
                     
                     
                        Estrogens, oral contraceptives, and clofibrate (and perhaps other lipid-lowering drugs) increase hepatic cholesterol secretion and encourage cholesterol gallstone formation and hence may counteract the effectiveness of ursodiol tablets, USP 250 mg and 500 mg.
