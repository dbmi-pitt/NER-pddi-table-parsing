                           Coadministration with CYP3A inhibitors, including protease inhibitors (except tipranavir/ritonavir) and delavirdine, will increase the concentration of SELZENTRY (7.1).
                           Coadministration with CYP3A inducers, including efavirenz, may decrease the concentration of SELZENTRY (7.1).
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 	Effect of Concomitant Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Maraviroc
                     
                        Maraviroc is a substrate of CYP3A and Pgp and hence its pharmacokinetics are likely to be modulated by inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes/transporters. Therefore, a dose adjustment may be required when maraviroc is coadministered with those drugs [see 
                              Dosage and Administration (2)
                           ]. 
                        Concomitant use of maraviroc and St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum) or products containing St. John's wort is not recommended. Coadministration of maraviroc with St. John's wort is expected to substantially decrease maraviroc concentrations and may result in suboptimal levels of maraviroc and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to maraviroc.
