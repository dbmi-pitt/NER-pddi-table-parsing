                  The water soluble vitamins are widely distributed in both plants and animals.  They are absorbed in man by both diffusion and active transport mechanisms.  These vitamins are structurally diverse (derivatives of sugar, pyridine, purines, pyrimidine, organic acid complexes and nucleotide complex) and act as coenzymes, as oxidation-reduction agents, possibly as mitochondrial agents.  Metabolism is rapid, and the excess is excreted in the urine.
                  Thiamine is distributed in all tissues.  The highest concentrations occur in liver, brain, kidney and heart.  When thiamine intake is greatly in excess of need, tissue stores increase two to three times.  If intake is insufficient, tissues become depleted of their vitamin content.  Absorption of thiamine following IM administration is rapid and complete.
                  Thiamine combines with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to form thiamine pyrophosphate, also known as cocarboxylase, a coenzyme.  Its role in carbohydrate metabolism is the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid in the blood and α-ketoacids to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide.  Increased levels of pyruvic acid in the blood indicate vitamin B1 deficiency.
                  The requirement for thiamine is greater when the carbohydrate content of the diet is raised.  Body depletion of vitamin B1 can occur after approximately three weeks of total absence of thiamine in the diet.
