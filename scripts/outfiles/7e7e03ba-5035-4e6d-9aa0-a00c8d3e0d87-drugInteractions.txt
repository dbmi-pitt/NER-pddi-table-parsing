                                 Antiarrhythmic Drugs: LIDODERM should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Local Anesthetics: When LIDODERM is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered.
