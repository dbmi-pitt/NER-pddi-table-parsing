                  Olopatadine is a relatively selective histamine H1 antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine from 
the mast cells. Decreased chemotaxis and inhibition of eosinophil activation has 
also been demonstrated. Olopatadine is devoid of effects on alpha-adrenergic, 
dopaminergic, and muscarinic type 1 and 2 receptors.
                  Systemic bioavailability data upon topical ocular administration of PATADAY™ solution are not available. Following topical ocular 
administration of olopatadine 0.15% ophthalmic solution in man, olopatadine was 
shown to have a low systemic exposure. Two studies in normal volunteers 
(totaling 24 subjects) dosed bilaterally with olopatadine 0.15% ophthalmic 
solution once every 12 hours for 2 weeks demonstrated plasma concentrations to 
be generally below the quantitation limit of the assay (< 0.5 ng/mL). Samples 
in which olopatadine was quantifiable were typically found within 2 hours of 
dosing and ranged from 0.5 to 1.3 ng/mL. The elimination half-life in plasma 
following oral dosing was 8 to 12 hours, and elimination was predominantly 
through renal excretion. Approximately 60 - 70% of the dose was recovered in the 
urine as parent drug. Two metabolites, the mono-desmethyl and the N-oxide, were 
detected at low concentrations in the urine.
