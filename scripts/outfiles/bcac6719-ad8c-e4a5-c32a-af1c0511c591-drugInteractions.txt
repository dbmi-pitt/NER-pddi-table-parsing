                           Calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medications may interfere with absorption of ibandronate. Do not take within 60 minutes of dosing (7.1) 

                           Use caution when co-prescribing aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation. (7.2) 
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Calcium Supplements/Antacids
                     
                        Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of ibandronate sodium. Therefore, instruct patients to take ibandronate sodium at least 60 minutes before any oral medications, including medications containing multivalent cations (such as antacids, supplements or vitamins). Also, patients should wait at least 60 minutes after dosing before taking any other oral medications (see Dosage and Administration [2.3]). 
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Aspirin/Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
                     
                        Because aspirin, NSAIDs, and bisphosphonates are all associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be exercised in the concomitant use of aspirin or NSAIDs with ibandronate sodium.

                        In healthy volunteers, coadministration with ranitidine resulted in a 20% increased bioavailability of ibandronate, which was not considered to be clinically relevant (see Clinical Pharmacology [12.3]). 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions
                     
                        Bisphosphonates are known to interfere with the use of bone-imaging agents. Specific studies with ibandronate have not been performed.
