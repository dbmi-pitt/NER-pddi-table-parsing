                  Mechanism of ActionAdapalene acts on retinoid receptors. Biochemical and 
pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator 
of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes all of 
which represent important features in the pathology of acne vulgaris.
                  Mechanistically, adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors 
but does not bind to the cytosolic receptor protein. Although the exact mode of 
action of adapalene is unknown, it is suggested that topical adapalene 
normalizes the differentiation of follicular epithelial cells resulting in 
decreased microcomedone formation.
                  
                  
                  PharmacokineticsAbsorption of adapalene from DIFFERIN® 
Cream through human skin is low. In a pharmacokinetic study with six acne 
patients treated once daily for 5 days with 2 grams of DIFFERIN® Cream applied to 1000 cm2 of acne 
involved skin, there were no quantifiable amounts (limit of quantification = 
0.35 ng/mL) of adapalene in the plasma samples from any patient. Excretion 
appears to be primarily by the biliary route.
