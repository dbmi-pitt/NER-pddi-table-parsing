The most important therapeutic action of atropine is the inhibition of smooth muscle and glands innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves. It also has central nervous system activity, which may be stimulating or depressing depending upon the dose.

                  
Following the administration of usual clinical doses, atropine produces stimulation of the medulla and higher cerebral centers. This effect is manifested by mild central vagal excitation and moderate respiratory stimulation. Atropine sulfate also acts peripherally as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic actions of acetycholine. It does not prevent the release of acetylcholine but antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine on the effector cells. These actions include vasodilation, drying of the mouth, an increase in the pulse rate, inhibition of contractions of the gastrointestinal tract, ureter, and bladder, and reduction of salivary, bronchial, gastric and sweat gland secretions. Following clinical and larger doses, atropine sulfate causes dilation of the pupils and paralysis of accommodation and, in narrow-angle glaucoma, can increase intraocular pressure.
