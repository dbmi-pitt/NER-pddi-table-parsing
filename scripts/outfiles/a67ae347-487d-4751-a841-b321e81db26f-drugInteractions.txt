Concurrent use of probenecid with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam.  The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone.  It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.  There are no data with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection and allopurinol administered concurrently.  Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection and aminoglycosides should not be reconstituted together due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by the ampicillin component of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection.
