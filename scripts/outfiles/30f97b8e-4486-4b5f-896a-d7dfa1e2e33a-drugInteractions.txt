                           Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors with alpha adrenergic antagonists, including alfuzosin HCl extended-release tablets, can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension (5.4, 7.4) 
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                     
                        Alfuzosin HCl extended-release tablets are contraindicated for use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir, since alfuzosin blood levels are increased [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.2 Alpha Adrenergic Antagonists
                     
                        The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between alfuzosin HCl extended-release tablets and other alpha adrenergic antagonists have not been determined. However, interactions may be expected, and alfuzosin HCl extended-release tablets should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic antagonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.3 Antihypertensive Medication and Nitrates
                     
                        There may be an increased risk of hypotension/postural hypotension and syncope when taking alfuzosin HCl extended-release tablets concomitantly with anti-hypertensive medication and nitrates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.4 PDE5 Inhibitors
                     
                        Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic antagonists, including alfuzosin HCl extended-release tablets, are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha adrenergic antagonists and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
