                  Ciclesonide is a pro-drug that is enzymatically hydrolyzed to a  pharmacologically active metabolite, C21-desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-ciclesonide or RM1) following intranasal application.  Des-ciclesonide has anti-inflammatory activity with affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor that is 120 times higher than the parent compound.

                  The precise mechanism through which ciclesonide affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known.  Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic inflammation.

                  
 

                  
                  
                     Adrenal Function: In a 6-week trial in adolescents and adults 12-73 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, a daily dose of 200 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray was compared to placebo nasal spray.  Dexamethasone 6 mg was used as an active control during the last 4 days of the treatment period.  Adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 24 hour serum cortisol levels before and after 6 consecutive weeks of treatment. The difference from placebo for the change from baseline in serum cortisol AUC(0-24) was 10.4 mcg•hour/dL (95% CI: -4.7, 25.5) for 200 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray. The effects observed with the active control (dexamethasone, n=18) validate the sensitivity of the study to assess the effect of ciclesonide on the HPA axis.

                  In a 12-week study in children 6 to 11 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, daily doses of 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray were compared to placebo nasal spray.  Adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 24-hour urinary-free cortisol (in 32 to 44 patients per group) and morning plasma cortisol levels (in 45 to 61 patients per group) before and after 12 consecutive weeks of treatment.  The ciclesonide-treated groups had a numerically greater decline in 24-hour urinary-free cortisol compared to the placebo-treated group.  The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks were -0.81 (-4.0, 2.4), -0.08 (-3.1, 2.9), and -2.11 (-5.3, 1.1) mcg/day for 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively.  The mean AM plasma cortisol value did not show any consistent treatment effect with differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks of 0.35 (-1.4, 2.1), 0.12 (-1.5, 1.7), and -0.38 (-2.1, 1.3) mcg/dL for 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively.   In this study, serum was assayed for ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                  In a 6-week study in children 2 to 5 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, daily doses of 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg of OMNARIS Nasal Spray were compared to placebo nasal spray.  Adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 24-hour urinary-free cortisol (in 15 to 22 patients per group) and morning plasma cortisol levels (in 28 to 30 patients per group) before and after 6 consecutive weeks of treatment.  The ciclesonide-treated groups had a numerically greater decline in 24-hour urinary-free cortisol compared to the placebo-treated group.   The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change from baseline to 6 weeks were -2.04 (-4.4, 0.3), -1.96 (-4.5, 0.6), and -1.76 (-4.3, 0.8) mcg/day for the 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively.  The plasma cortisol also decreased numerically after treatment with ciclesonide.  The differences (and 95% confidence intervals) from placebo in the mean change in plasma cortisol from baseline to 6 weeks were -1.04 (-2.7, 0.7), -0.36 (-2.1, 1.4), and -0.12 (-1.8, 1.6) mcg/dL for the 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg dose groups, respectively.  In this study, serum was assayed for ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

                  
 

                  
                  
                     Absorption:  Ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide have negligible oral bioavailability (both less than 1%) due to low gastrointestinal absorption and high first-pass metabolism.  The intranasal administration of ciclesonide at recommended doses results in negligible serum concentrations of ciclesonide.  However, the known active metabolite (des-ciclesonide) is detected in the serum of some patients after nasal inhalation of ciclesonide.  The bioanalytical assay used has a lower limit of quantification of 25 pg/mL and 10 pg/mL, for ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide, respectively.

                  In healthy adults treated for two weeks with 50 to 800 mcg of ciclesonide nasal spray daily (n=6 in each treatment group), the peak serum concentrations of des-ciclesonide in all subjects were found to be below 30 pg/mL.  Of those treated with 800 mcg and 400 mcg daily, 100% and 67% had detectable levels of des-ciclesonide, respectively.  With daily doses of 200 mcg or less, detectable serum levels of des-ciclesonide were not observed. The low systemic exposure following ciclesonide nasal spray administration was confirmed in a crossover study in twenty-nine healthy adults. The median Cmax was less than 10 pg/mL and 602 pg/mL following a single dose of ciclesonide nasal spray (300 mcg) and orally inhaled ciclesonide (320 mcg), respectively.

                  
 

                  
                  
                     Distribution:  Following intravenous administration of 800 mcg of ciclesonide, the volumes of distribution of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide were approximately 2.9 L/kg and 12.1 L/kg, respectively.  The percentage of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide bound to human plasma proteins averaged ≥ 99% each, with ≤ 1% of unbound drug detected in the systemic circulation.  Des-ciclesonide is not significantly bound to human transcortin.

                  
 

                  
                  
                     Metabolism:  Ciclesonide is hydrolyzed to a biologically active metabolite, des-ciclesonide, by esterases.  Des-ciclesonide undergoes further metabolism in the liver to additional metabolites mainly by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isozyme and to a lesser extent by CYP 2D6.  The full range of potentially active metabolites of ciclesonide has not been characterized.  After intravenous administration of 14C-ciclesonide, 19.3% of the resulting radioactivity in the plasma is accounted for by ciclesonide or des-ciclesonide; the remainder may be a result of other, as yet, unidentified multiple metabolites.

                  
 

                  
                  
                     Elimination:  Following intravenous administration of 800 mcg of ciclesonide, the clearance values of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide were high (approximately 152 L/h and 228 L/h, respectively).  14C-labeled ciclesonide was predominantly excreted via the feces after intravenous administration (66%) indicating that excretion through bile is the major route of elimination.  Approximately 20% or less of drug-related radioactivity was excreted in the urine.

                  
 

                  
                  
                     Special Populations:  The pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered ciclesonide have not been assessed in patient subpopulations because the resulting blood levels of ciclesonide and des-ciclesonide are insufficient for pharmacokinetic calculations.  However, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that characteristics of des-ciclesonide after oral inhalation of ciclesonide were not appreciably influenced by a variety of subject characteristics such as body weight, age, race, and gender.

                  
 

                  
                  
                     Hepatic Impairment:  Compared to healthy subjects, the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) in patients with liver impairment increased in the range of 1.4 to 2.7-fold after ex-actuator administration of 1280 mcg ciclesonide via oral inhalation.  Dose adjustment in liver impairment is not necessary.

                  
 

                  
                  
                     Renal Impairment:  Studies in renally-impaired patients were not conducted since renal excretion of des-ciclesonide is a minor route of elimination (≤ 20%).

                  
 

                  
                  
                     Pediatric: In pediatric subjects treated with 25 to 200 mcg of ciclesonide nasal spray daily, serum concentrations of des-ciclesonide were below 45 pg/mL, with the exception of one value of 64.5 pg/mL. In a 12-week study in children 6 to 11 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, des-ciclesonide was detected in 50% of the subjects treated with 200 mcg and in 5% of those treated with 100 mcg ciclesonide nasal spray daily. In a 6-week study in children 2 to 5 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, des-ciclesonide was detected in 41%, 22%, and 13% of the subjects treated with 200 mcg, 100 mcg, and 25 mcg ciclesonide nasal spray daily, respectively.

                  
 

                  
                  
                     Drug-Drug Interactions: Based on in vitro studies in human liver microsomes, des-ciclesonide appears to have no inhibitory or induction potential on the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The inhibitory potential of ciclesonide on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes has not been studied. In vitro studies demonstrated that the plasma protein binding of des-ciclesonide was not affected by warfarin or salicylic acid, indicating no potential for protein binding-based drug interactions.

                  In a drug interaction study, co-administration of orally inhaled ciclesonide and oral ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, increased the exposure (AUC) of the active metabolite of ciclesonide, des-ciclesonide, by approximately 3.6-fold at steady state, while levels of ciclesonide remained unchanged.

                  In another drug interaction study, co-administration of orally inhaled ciclesonide and oral erythromycin, a moderate inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either des-ciclesonide or erythromycin.
