                  A number of medications affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring.  
                  The following are examples of medications that may increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LEVEMIR and, therefore, increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral antidiabetic medications, pramlintide acetate, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide antibiotics. 
                  The following are examples of medications that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LEVEMIR: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine).
                  Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either increase or decrease the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin.  Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia.
                  The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism  requiring insulin dose adjustment  and close monitoring of blood glucose (7) 
                           The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti-adrenergic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine). (7)
