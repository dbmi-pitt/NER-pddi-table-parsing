                        General:  Sympathomimetic amines may reduce the antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids.

                        

                        Other CNS Depressants:  Patients receiving other opioid analgesics, sedatives or hypnotics, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, centrally acting anti-emetics, phenothiazines or other tranquilizers, or alcohol concomitantly with this product may exhibit additive depressant effects on the central nervous system.  When such combination therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.  Concomitant use of dihydrocodeine with alcohol and other CNS depressants may have an additive effect.

                        

                        Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors:  Dihydrocodeine, like all opioids, interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors causing central nervous system excitation and hypertension.  MAO inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers increase the effects of sympathomimetics.
