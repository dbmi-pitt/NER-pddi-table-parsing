                  Drug Interactions

                  
                  

                  Oral Anticoagulants

                  CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN COUMARIN ANTICOAGULANTS ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH FENOFIBRATE CAPSULES. THE DOSAGE OF THE ANTICOAGULANTS SHOULD BE REDUCED TO MAINTAIN THE PROTHROMBIN TIME/INR AT THE DESIRED LEVEL TO PREVENT BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS. FREQUENT PROTHROMBIN TIME/INR DETERMINATIONS ARE ADVISABLE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY DETERMINED THAT THE PROTHROMBIN TIME/INR HAS STABILIZED.

                  

                  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors

                  The combined use of fenofibrate capsules and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination (seeWARNINGS).

                  

                  Resins

                  Since bile acid sequestrants may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take fenofibrate capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.

                  

                  Cyclosporine

                  Because cyclosporine can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs including fenofibrate capsules, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration. The benefits and risks of using fenofibrate capsules with immunosuppresants and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dose employed.
