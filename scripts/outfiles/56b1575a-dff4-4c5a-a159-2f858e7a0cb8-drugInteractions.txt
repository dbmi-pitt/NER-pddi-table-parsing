                        Tizoxanide is highly bound to plasma protein (>99.9%). Therefore, caution should be used when administering nitazoxanide concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., warfarin). In vitro metabolism studies have demonstrated that tizoxanide has no significant inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes. Although no drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted in vivo, it is expected that no significant interaction would occur when nitazoxanide is co-administered with drugs that either are metabolized by or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes.
