                           Calcium supplements, antacids, or oral      medications containing multivalent cations interfere with absorption of      alendronate. (2.6, 7.1)
                           Use caution when co-prescribing      aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal      irritation. (7.2, 7.3)

                        Co-administration of alendronate sodium and calcium, antacids, or oral medications containing multivalent cations will interfere with absorption of alendronate sodium. Therefore, instruct patients to wait at least one-half hour after taking alendronate sodium before taking any other oral medications.

                        In clinical studies, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events was increased in patients receiving concomitant therapy with daily doses of alendronate sodium greater than 10 mg and aspirin-containing products. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
                     
                        Alendronate sodium may be administered to patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In a 3-year, controlled, clinical study (n=2027) during which a majority of patients received concomitant NSAIDs, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events was similar in patients taking alendronate sodium  5 or 10 mg/day compared to those taking placebo. However, since NSAID use is associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be used during concomitant use with alendronate sodium.
