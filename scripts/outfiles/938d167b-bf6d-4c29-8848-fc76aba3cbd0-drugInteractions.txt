                  Use with Other Drugs:

                  In a study (n=24) where terazosin and verapamil were administered concomitantly, terazosin's mean AUC0-24 increased 11% after the first verapamil dose and after 3 weeks of verapamil treatment it increased by 24% with associated increases in Cmax (25%) and Cmin (32%) means. Terazosin mean Tmax decreased from 1.3 hours to 0.8 hours after 3 weeks of verapamil treatment. Statistically significant differences were not found in the verapamil level with and without terazosin. In a study (n=6) where terazosin and captopril were administered concomitantly, plasma disposition of captopril was not influenced by concomitant administration of terazosin and terazosin maximum plasma concentrations increased linearly with dose at steady-state after administration of terazosin plus captopril (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
