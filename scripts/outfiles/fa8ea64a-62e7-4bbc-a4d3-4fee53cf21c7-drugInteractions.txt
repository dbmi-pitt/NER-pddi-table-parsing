                        Cyclobenzaprine may have life-threatening interactions with MAO inhibitors (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Postmarketing cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride and other drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tramadol, bupropion, meperidine, verapamil, or monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. If concomitant treatment with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, careful observation is advised, particularly during treatment initiation or dose increases (see WARNINGS).
                        Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.
                        Tricyclic antidepressants may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine and similarly acting compounds. 
                        Tricyclic antidepressants may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking tramadol.†
