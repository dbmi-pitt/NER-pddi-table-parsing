Drug Interactions
Renal toxicity has been reported in a few patients with liver dysfunction who were given oral cholecystographic agents followed by urographic agents. Administration of intravascular urographic agents should therefore be postponed in any patient with a known or suspected hepatic or biliary disorder who has recently received a cholecystographic contrast agent.Addition of an inotropic agent to contrast agents may produce a paradoxical depressant response which can be deleterious to the ischemic myocardium.Diphenhydramine hydrochloride may cause precipitation when mixed in the same syringe with HYPAQUE meglumine 60%.Under certain circumstances (pH, temperature, concentrations, time), diatrizoate solutions are incompatible with promethazine hydrochloride, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, brompheniramine maleate, or papaverine hydrochloride solutions.Do not prefill plastic syringes with HYPAQUE meglumine 60% for prolonged periods (ie, for several hours or longer) before use.
