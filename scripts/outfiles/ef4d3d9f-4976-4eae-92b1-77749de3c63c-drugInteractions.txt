Drug Interactions:  Dantrium is metabolized by the liver, and it is theoretically possible that its metabolism may be enhanced by drugs known to induce hepatic microsomal enzymes.  However, neither phenobarbital nor diazepam appears to affect Dantrium metabolism.  Binding to plasma protein is not significantly altered by diazepam, diphenylhydantoin, or phenylbutazone.  Binding to plasma proteins is reduced by warfarin and clofibrate and increased by tolbutamide.Drug Interactions:  Dantrium is metabolized by the liver, and it is theoretically possible that its metabolism may be enhanced by drugs known to induce hepatic microsomal enzymes.  However, neither phenobarbital nor diazepam appears to affect Cardiovascular collapse in patients treated simultaneously with verapamil and dantrolene sodium is rare.  The combination of therapeutic doses of intravenous dantrolene sodium and verapamil in halothane/alpha-chloralose anesthetized swine has resulted in ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse in association with marked hyperkalemia.  It is recommended that the combination of intravenous dantrolene sodium and calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, not be used together during the management of malignant hyperthermia crisis until the relevance of these findings to humans is established.Administration of dantrolene may potentiate vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block.
