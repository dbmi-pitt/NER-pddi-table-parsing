                        Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
                        Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin.
                        Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
                        The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.
                        Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective.
