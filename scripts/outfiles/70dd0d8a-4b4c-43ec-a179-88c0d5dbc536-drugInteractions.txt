                  For the concurrent therapy of either cyclosporine, fibrates, niacin (nicotinic acid), or erythromycin, the risk of myopathy increases [see Warnings and Precautions (

                           Concomitant lipid-lowering therapies: use with fibrates or lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with pravastatin. (7) 
                           Cyclosporine:combination increases exposure. Limit pravastatin to 20 mg once daily.(2.5,7.1) 
                           Clarithromycin: combination increases exposure. Limit pravastatin to 40 mg once daily.(2.6,7.2)

                        The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant administration of colchicine [see Warnings and Precautions

                        Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are coadministered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of pravastatin sodium with gemfibrozil should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (

                        Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, pravastatin sodium should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates [see Warnings and Precautions 
                           
                              (5.1

                        The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when pravastatin is used in combination with niacin; a reduction in pravastatin sodium dosage should be considered in this setting [see Warnings and Precautions
