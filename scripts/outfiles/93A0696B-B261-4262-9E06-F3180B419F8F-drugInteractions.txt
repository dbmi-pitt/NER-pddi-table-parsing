Drug interactions
The risk of using bromocriptine mesylate in combination with other drugs has not been systematically evaluated, but alcohol may potentiate the side effects of bromocriptine mesylate. Bromocriptine mesylate may interact with dopamine antagonists, butyrophenones, and certain other agents. Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of bromocriptine mesylate: phenothiazines, haloperidol, metoclopramide, pimozide. Concomitant use of bromocriptine mesylate with other ergot alkaloids is not recommended.
