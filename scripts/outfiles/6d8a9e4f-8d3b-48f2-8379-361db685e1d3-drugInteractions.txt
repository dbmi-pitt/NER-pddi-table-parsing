                     7.1 Coumarin Anticoagulants

                     
                        Potentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulant effect has been observed with prolongation of the PT/INR.

                        Caution should be exercised when fenofibrate is given in conjunction with coumarin anticoagulants. Fenofibrate may potentiate the anticoagulant effect of these agents resulting in prolongation of the PT/INR.  To prevent bleeding complications, frequent monitoring of PT/INR and dose adjustment of the oral anticoagulant as recommended until the PT/INR has stabilized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Immunosuppressants

                     
                         Immunosuppressant agents such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus can impair renal function and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs including fenofibrate capsules, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration of renal function. When immunosuppressants and other potentially nephrotoxic agents are co-administered with fenofibrate capsules, the lowest effective dose of fenofibrate capsules should be employed and renal function should be monitored.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Bile-Acid Binding Resins

                     
                        Since bile-acid binding resins may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take fenofibrate at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 Colchicine

                     
                        Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing fenofibrate with colchicine.
