                  The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) [see 
                        Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)
                      and 
                        Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                     ].
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        


                        



                           Other Lipid-Lowering Medications: Use with fibrate products or lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with atorvastatin calcium tablets (7).
                            Digoxin: Patients should be monitored appropriately (7.8).
                            Oral Contraceptives: Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased (7.9).
                            Rifampin should be simultaneously co-administered with atorvastatin calcium tablets (7.7).
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1  Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4:
                     
                        Atorvastatin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                   Clarithromycin: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of atorvastatin calcium tablets alone [see 
                                    Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                                 ]. Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the atorvastatin dose exceeds 20 mg [see 
                                    Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)
                                  and 
                                    Dosage and Administration (2.6)
                                 ].
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Combination of Protease Inhibitors: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of  atorvastatin calcium tablets with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of atorvastatin calcium tablets alone [see 
                                       Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                                    ]. Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of atorvastatin calcium tablets should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopinavir plus ritonavir, caution should be used when prescribing atorvastatin calcium tablets and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution [see 
                                       Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)
                                     and 
                                       Dosage and Administration (2.6)
                                    ]. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring is recommended. 										
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Itraconazole: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg [see 
                                    Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                                 ]. Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should be used when the atorvastatin dose exceeds 20 mg [see

                     7.2  Grapefruit Juice:
                     
                        Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (>1.2 liters per day).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3  Cyclosporine:
                     
                        
                           Atorvastatin and atorvastatin-metabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mg/kg/day compared to that of atorvastatin calcium tablets alone [see 
                                 Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                              ]. The co-administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets with cyclosporine should be avoided  [see 
                                 Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)
                              ].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4  Gemfibrozil:
                     
                        
                           Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are co-administered with gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets with gemfibrozil should be avoided [see 
                                 Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                              ].

                           Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, atorvastatin calcium tablets should be administered with caution when used concomitantly with other fibrates [see 
                                 Warnings and Precautions (5.1)

                           The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when atorvastatin calcium tablets are used in combination with niacin; a reduction in atorvastatin calcium tablets dosage should be considered in this setting [see 
                                 Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                              ].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.7  Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4:
                     
                        Concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous co-administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of atorvastatin after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.8  Digoxin:
                     
                        When multiple doses of atorvastatin calcium tablets and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.9  Oral Contraceptives:
                     
                        Co-administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol [see 
                              Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                           ]. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.

                           Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.
