                  Zidovudine competitively inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of stavudine. Therefore, use of zidovudine in combination with stavudine should be avoided. 
                  
                     In vitro data indicate that the phosphorylation of stavudine is also inhibited at relevant concentrations by doxorubicin and ribavirin. The clinical significance of these in vitro interactions is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with either of these drugs should be undertaken with caution. (See
