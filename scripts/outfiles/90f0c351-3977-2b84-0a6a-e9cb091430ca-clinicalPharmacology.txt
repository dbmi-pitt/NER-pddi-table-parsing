                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        
Albumin is responsible for 75-80% of the colloid osmotic pressure of normal plasma. Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and is a carrier of hormones, enzymes, medicinal products and toxins.  [

Albumin is a protein with a total extravascular mass of approximately 160 g and an intravascular mass of about 120 g. [

                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        
The colloid osmotic effect of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 20% and 25% is approximately 5 times the volume administered. When injected intravenously, it will increase circulating plasma volume by approximately 3.5 times the volume infused within 15 minutes if the patient is adequately hydrated. This extra fluid reduces hemoconcentration and blood viscosity. The degree and duration of volume expansion depends upon the initial blood volume. When treating patients with diminished blood volume, the effect of infused albumin may persist for many hours. The hemodilution lasts for a shorter time when albumin is administered to individuals with normal blood volume. [
