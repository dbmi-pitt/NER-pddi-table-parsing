                  When administered intravenously as a vehicle for drugs, sterile water for injection provides a source of water for parenteral fluid replenishment after sufficient solute is introduced to achieve an osmolarity of 112 mOsmol or more per liter.
                  Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).
                  Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.
