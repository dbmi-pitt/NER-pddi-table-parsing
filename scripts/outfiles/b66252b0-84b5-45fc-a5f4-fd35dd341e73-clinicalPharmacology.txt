horny layer of skin while not effecting qualitative or quantitative
changes in the structure of the viable epidermis. The mechanism
of action has been attributed to a dissolution of intercellular
cement substance.
In a study of the percutaneous absorption of salicylic acid in a 6%
salicylic acid gel in four patients with extensive active psoriasis,
Taylor and Halprin showed that the peak serum salicylate levels
never exceeded 5 mg/100 ml even though more than 60% of the
applied salicylic acid was absorbed. Systemic toxic reactions are
usually associated with much higher serum levels (30 to
40 mg/100ml).
Peak serum levels occurred within five hours of the topical appli-
cation under occlusion. The sites were occluded for 10 hours over
the entire body surface below the neck. Since salicylates are dis-
tributed in the extracellular space, patients with a contracted
extracellular space due to dehydration or diuretics have a higher
salicylate levels than those with a normal extracellular space. (See

The major metabolites identified in the urine after topical admin-
istration are salicyluric acid (52%), salicylate glucuronides (42%)
and free salicylic acid (6%). The urinary metabolites after percu-
taneous absorption differ from those after oral salicylate adminis-
tration; those derived from percutaneous absorption contain
more salicylate glucuronides and less salicyluric and salicylic
acid. Almost 95% of a single dose of salicylate is excreted within
24 hours of its entrance into the extracellular space.
Fifty to eighty percent of a salicylate is protein bound to albumin.
Salicylates compete with the binding of several drugs and can
modify the actions of these drugs; by similar competitive mech-
anisms other drugs can influence the serum levels of salicylate.
