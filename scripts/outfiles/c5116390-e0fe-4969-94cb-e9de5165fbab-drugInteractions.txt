                              Strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): Coadministration with ONGLYZA significantly increases saxagliptin concentrations. Recommend limiting ONGLYZA dosage to 2.5 mg once daily.

                     7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 Enzymes
                     
                        Ketoconazole significantly increased saxagliptin exposure. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin). The dose of ONGLYZA should be limited to 2.5 mg when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3) and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                           ].
