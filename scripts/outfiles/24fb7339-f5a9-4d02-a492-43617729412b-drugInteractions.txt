                  Formal drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted for PATANASE Nasal Spray. Drug interactions with inhibitors of liver enzymes are not anticipated because olopatadine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Drug interactions involving P450 inhibition and plasma protein binding are also not expected. [See
