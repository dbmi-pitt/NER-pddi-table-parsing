                  Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that inhibits 
the growth of pathogenic yeasts by altering the permeability of cell membranes. 
The action of clotrimazole is fungistatic at concentrations of drug up to 20 
mcg/mL and may be fungicidal in vitro against Candida albicans and other species of the genus Candida at higher concentrations. No single-step or 
multiple-step resistance to clotrimazole has developed during successive 
passages of Candida albicans in the laboratory; 
however, individual organism tolerance has been observed during successive 
passages in the laboratory. Such in vitro tolerance 
has resolved once the organism has been removed from the antifungal 
environment.
                  After oral administration of a 10 mg clotrimazole lozenge to healthy 
volunteers, concentrations sufficient to inhibit most species of Candida persist in saliva for up to three hours following 
the approximately 30 minutes needed for a lozenge to dissolve. The long term 
persistence of drug in saliva appears to be related to the slow release of 
clotrimazole from the oral mucosa to which the drug is apparently bound. 
Repetitive dosing at three hour intervals maintains salivary levels above the 
minimum inhibitory concentrations of most strains of Candida; however, the relationship between in vitro susceptibility of pathogenic fungi to clotrimazole 
and prophylaxis or cure of infections in humans has not been established.
                  In another study, the mean serum concentrations were 4.98 ± 3.7 and 3.23 ± 
1.4 nanograms/mL of clotrimazole at 30 and 60 minutes, respectively, after 
administration as a lozenge.
