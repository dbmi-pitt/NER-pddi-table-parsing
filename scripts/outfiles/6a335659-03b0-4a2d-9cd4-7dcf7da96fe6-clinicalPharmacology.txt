                  Typical serum and urine levels following a single 150 mg dose of Colistimethate for Injection, USP IM or IV in normal adult subjects are shown in Figure 1.

                  Higher serum levels were obtained at 10 minutes following IV administration. Serum concentration declined with a half-life of 2–3 hours following either intravenous or intramuscular administration in adults and in the pediatric population, including premature infants.
Average urine levels ranged from about 270 mcg/mL at 2 hours to about 15 mcg/mL at 8 hours after intravenous administration and from 200 to about 25 mcg/mL during a similar period following intramuscular administration.
