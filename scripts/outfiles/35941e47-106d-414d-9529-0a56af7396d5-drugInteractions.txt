                     7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs
                     
                        Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and FROVA within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [ ].

                        Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of FROVA and other 5-HT agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [ ].

                        Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [ ].
