               Synergism between xanthine bronchodilators (e.g., theophylline), ephedrine and other sympathomimetic 
bronchodilators has been reported. This should be considered whenever these agents are prescribed 
concomitantly. Concurrent administration of dyphylline and probenecid, which competes for tubular secretion, 
has been shown to increase plasma half-life and dyphylline (See Clinical Pharmacology).
