                              •Calcium supplements, antacids or oral medications containing multivalent cations interfere with absorption of alendronate. (2.6, 7.1)
                           
                              •Use caution when coprescribing aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation.

                     7.1  Calcium Supplements/Antacids
                     
                        Coadministration of alendronate and calcium, antacids, or oral medications containing multivalent cations will interfere with absorption of alendronate. Therefore, instruct patients to wait at least one-half hour after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medications.

                        In clinical studies, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events was increased in patients receiving concomitant therapy with daily doses of alendronate greater than 10 mg and aspirin-containing products.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3  Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
                     
                        Alendronate may be administered to patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In a 3-year, controlled, clinical study (n = 2,027) during which a majority of patients received concomitant NSAIDs, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events was similar in patients taking alendronate 5 or 10 mg/day compared to those taking placebo. However, since NSAID use is associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be used during concomitant use with alendronate.
