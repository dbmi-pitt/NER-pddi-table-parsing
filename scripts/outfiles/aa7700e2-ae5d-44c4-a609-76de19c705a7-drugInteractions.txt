                  The following have been reported with other oral immediate release formulations of clonidine:
                  


                  



               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Sedating Drugs: Clonidine may potentiate the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedating drugs. (7)
                           Tricyclic Antidepressants: May reduce the hypotensive effect of clonidine. (7)
                           Drugs Known to Affect Sinus Node Function or AV Nodal Conduction: Caution is warranted in patients receiving clonidine concomitantly with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers) due to a potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block. (7)
                           Antihypertensive drugs: Use caution when coadministered with KAPVAY. (7)
