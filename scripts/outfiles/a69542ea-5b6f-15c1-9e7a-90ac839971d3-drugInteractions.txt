                  Significant drug interactions with lamotrigine are summarized in this section. Additional details of these drug interaction studies, which were conducted using immediate-release lamotrigine, are provided in the Clinical Pharmacology section [see Clinical
                     Pharmacology (12.3)].

                     Effect of Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets on Organic Cationic Transporter 2 Substrates 
                  
                  Lamotrigine is an inhibitor of renal tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter 2 (OCT2) proteins [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. This may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs that are substantially excreted via this route. Coadministration of lamotrigine extended-release tablets with OCT2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., dofetilide) is not recommended. 
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Valproate increases lamotrigine concentrations more than 2-fold. (7, 12.3)
                           Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone and rifampin decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 40%. (7, 12.3)
                           Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 50%. (7, 12.3) 
                           Protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/lopinavir decrease lamotrigine exposure by approximately 50% and 32%, respectively. (7, 12.3) 
                           Coadministration with organic cationic transporter 2 substrates with narrow therapeutic index is not recommended (7, 12.3)
