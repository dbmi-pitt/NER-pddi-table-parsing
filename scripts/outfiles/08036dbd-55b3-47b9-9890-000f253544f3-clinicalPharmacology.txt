                  Elliotts B Solution provides a buffered salt solution for use as a diluent for the intrathecal
administration of methotrexate sodium and cytarabine. It has been demonstrated
that Elliotts B Solution is comparable to cere­brospinal fluid in pH,
electrolyte composition, glucose content, and osmolarity:

The approximate buffer capacity of Elliotts B
Solution is 1.1 X 10-2 equivalents when the challenge solution is
0.01 N HCl and 7.8 X 10-3 equivalents when the challenge solution is
0.01 N NaOH.

                  Compatibility studies with methotrexate sodium
and cytarabine indicate these drugs are physically compati­ble with Elliotts B
Solution.
