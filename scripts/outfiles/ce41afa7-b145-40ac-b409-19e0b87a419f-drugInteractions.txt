                  No drug interaction studies have been conducted with NEXICLON XR Tablet. The following have been reported with other oral formulations of clonidine.
                  Clonidine may potentiate the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedating drugs. If a patient receiving clonidine hydrochloride is also taking tricyclic antidepressants, the hypotensive effect of clonidine may be reduced, necessitating an increase in the clonidine dose.
                  Monitor heart rate in patients receiving clonidine concomitantly with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction, e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers. Sinus bradycardia resulting in hospitalization and pacemaker insertion has been reported in association with the use of clonidine concomitantly with diltiazem or verapamil.
                  Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats [see

                     ].
                  
                     Alcohol: Based on in vitro studies, high concentration of alcohol may increase the rate of release of NEXICLON XR Tablets.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                            Sedating drugs: Clonidine may potentiate the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedating drugs (7)
                            Tricyclic antidepressants: May reduce the hypotensive effect of clonidine, necessitating an increase in clonidine dose (7)
                            Drugs known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers): Additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block (7)
