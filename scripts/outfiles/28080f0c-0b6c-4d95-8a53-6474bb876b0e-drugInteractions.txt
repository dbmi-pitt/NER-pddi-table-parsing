                        In vitro drug metabolism studies suggest that there is a potential for drug interactions when trazodone is given with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Ritonavir, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the Cmax, AUC, and elimination half-life, and decreased clearance of trazodone after administration of ritonavir twice daily for 2 days. Adverse effects including nausea, hypotension, and syncope were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were co-administered. It is likely that ketoconazole, indinavir, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as intraconazole or nefazadone may lead to substantial increases in trazodone plasma concentrations, with the potential for adverse effects. If trazodone is used with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, a lower dose of trazodone should be considered.
                        Carbamazepine reduced plasma concentrations of trazodone when co-administered. Patients should be more closely monitored to see if there is a need for an increased dose of trazodone when taking both drugs.
                        Increased serum digoxin or phenytoin levels have been reported to occur in patients receiving trazodone concurrently with either of those two drugs.
                        It is not known whether interactions will occur between monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and trazodone HCl. Due to the absence of clinical experience, if MAO inhibitors are discontinued shortly before or are to be given concomitantly with trazodone HCl, therapy should be initiated cautiously with gradual increase in dosage until optimum response is achieved.
