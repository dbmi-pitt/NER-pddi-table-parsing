                  Peginterferon alfa-2b inhibits CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 activity. When caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) or desipramine (CYP2D6 substrate) was coadministered with peginterferon alfa-2b (3 mcg/kg once weekly for two weeks), the exposure to caffeine increased 36% and the exposure to desipramine increased 30% as compared to when caffeine or desipramine was administered alone. Monitor for potential increased toxicities of drugs with a narrow therapeutic range metabolized by CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 when coadministered with SYLATRON.
