                           Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use of amoxicillin and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin.

                     7.1    Probenecid

                     
                        Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin.  Concurrent use of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin.  The clinical relevance of this finding has not been evaluated.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2    Other Antibiotics

                     
                        Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillin.  This has been demonstrated in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3    Oral Contraceptives

                     
                        As with other antibiotics, amoxicillin may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and potentially resulting in reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.
