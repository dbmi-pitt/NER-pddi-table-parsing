                  Sodium Sulfacetamide exhibits antibacterial activity. It is believed to block
bacterial growth by acting as a competitive antagonist of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). While absorption
through intact skin has not been determined for sodium sulfacetamide, it is estimated that 1% of topically applied
sulfur is absorbed. Although the exact mode of the keralytic activity of sulfur is unknown, it is reported to result
from the interaction of sulfur with the cysteine content of keratinocytes. In combination with sulfacetamide, sulfur
has been reported to inhibit P. acnes, thereby reducing the associated inflammation.
