                        Exercise caution in patients concurrently taking drugs known to inhibit drug metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily. Concurrent administration of vinorelbine with an inhibitor of this metabolic pathway may cause an earlier onset and/or an increased severity of adverse reactions.
