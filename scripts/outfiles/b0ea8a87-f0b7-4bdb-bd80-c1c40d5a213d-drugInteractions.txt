                  Table 14 contains clinically important drug interactions with guanfacine extended-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                  


               



               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              •Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase guanfacine exposure. Decrease guanfacine extended-release tablets to 50% of target dosage when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (2.7).
                           
                              •Strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease guanfacine exposure. Based on patient response, consider titrating guanfacine extended-release tablets dosage up to double the target dosage over 1 to 2 weeks (2.7).
