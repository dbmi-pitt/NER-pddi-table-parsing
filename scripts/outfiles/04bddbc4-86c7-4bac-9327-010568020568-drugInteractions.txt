                        The CNS effects of butalbital may be enhanced by monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.
                        In patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids and chronic use of aspirin, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in salicylism because corticosteroids enhance renal clearance of salicylates and their withdrawal is followed by return to normal rates of renal clearance.
                        Butalbital, aspirin, caffeine and codeine may enhance the effects of:
                        
                           Oral anticoagulants, causing bleeding by inhibiting prothrombin formation in the liver and displacing anticoagulants from plasma protein binding sites.

                           Oral antidiabetic agents and insulin, causing hypoglycemia by contributing to an additive effect, if dosage of this product exceeds maximum recommended daily dosage.

                           6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, causing bone marrow toxicity and blood dyscrasias by displacing these drugs from secondary binding sites, and, in the case of  methotrexate, also reducing its excretion.

                           Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, increasing the risk of peptic ulceration and bleeding by contributing additive effects.

                           Other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
                        
                        Butalbital, aspirin, caffeine and codeine may diminish the effects of:
                        Uricosuric agents such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, reducing their effectiveness in the treatment of gout. Aspirin competes with these agents for protein binding sites.
