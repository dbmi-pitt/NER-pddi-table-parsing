                        Dopamine antagonists may diminish the effectiveness of pramipexole (7.1).

                        Since pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     7.2 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions
                     
                        There are no known interactions between pramipexole and laboratory tests.
