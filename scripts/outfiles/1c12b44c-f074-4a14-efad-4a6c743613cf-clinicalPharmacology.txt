                  Liposyn II (Intravenous Fat Emulsion) provides the
patient requiring parenteral nutrition with a source of calories and
the essential fatty acids normally obtained from a nutritionally complete
oral diet. The supplemental polyunsaturated fat prevents biochemical
changes of essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) and prevents and
reverses EFAD clinical manifestations (e.g., scaliness of skin, growth
retardation, poor wound healing and sparse hair growth).
                  The infused fat particles are cleared from the bloodstream
in a manner thought to be similar to the clearing of chylomicrons.
Following infusion, there is a transient increase in plasma triglycerides.
The triglycerides are hydrolyzed to free fatty acids and glycerol
by the enzyme, lipoprotein lipase. The free fatty acids either enter
the tissues (where they may be oxidized or resynthesized into triglycerides
and stored) or circulate in the plasma, bound to albumin. In the liver,
circulating free fatty acids are oxidized or converted to very low
density lipoproteins that re-enter the bloodstream.
                  Phosphatides are the hydrophobic components of membranes and provide
electrically insulated layers. They are involved in the formation
of membrane structures. Choline prevents the deposition of fat in
the liver.
                  Glycerol is metabolized to carbon
dioxide and glycogen or is used in the synthesis of body fats.
