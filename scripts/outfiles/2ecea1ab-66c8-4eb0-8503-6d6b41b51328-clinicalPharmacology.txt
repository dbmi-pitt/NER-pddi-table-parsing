                  Barium sulfate, due to its high molecular density
is opaque to x-rays and, therefore, acts as a positive contrast agent
for radiographic studies. Barium sulfate is biologically inert and,
therefore, is not absorbed or metabolized by the body and is eliminated
unchanged from the body.
