- Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI): Fluoxetine is contraindicated for use with MAOI’s, or within 14 days of discontinuing an MAOI due to risk of drug interaction. At least 5 weeks should be allowed after stopping fluoxetine before starting treatment with an MAOI (4, 7.1) 
- Pimozide: Fluoxetine is contraindicated for use with pimozide due to risk of drug interaction or QTc prolongation (4, 7.9) 
- Thioridazine: Fluoxetine is contraindicated for use with thioridazine due to QTc interval prolongation or potential for elevated thioridazine plasma levels. Do not use thioridazine within 5 weeks of discontinuing fluoxetine (4, 7.9) 
- Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Fluoxetine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 enzyme pathway (7.9) 
- Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs): Monitor TCA levels during coadministration with fluoxetine or when fluoxetine has been recently discontinued (7.9) 
- CNS Acting Drugs: Caution should be used when taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs (7.2) 
- Benzodiazepines: Diazepam – increased t1/2, alprazolam - further psychomotor performance decrement due to increased levels (7.9) 
- Antipsychotics: Potential for elevation of haloperidol and clozapine levels (7.9) 
- Anticonvulsants: Potential for elevated phenytoin and carbamazepine levels and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity (7.9) 
- Serotonergic Drugs: Potential for Serotonin Syndrome (5.2, 7.3) 
- Triptans: There have been rare postmarketing reports of Serotonin Syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan (5.2, 7.4) 
- Tryptophan: Concomitant use with tryptophan is not recommended (5.2, 7.5) 
- Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin): May potentiate the risk of bleeding (7.6) 
- Drugs Tightly Bound to Plasma Proteins: May cause a shift in plasma concentrations (7.8, 7.9)
