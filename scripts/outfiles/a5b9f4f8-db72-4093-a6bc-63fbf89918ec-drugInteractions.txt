                  Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, antihistamines, 
antipsychotics, antianxiety agents, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) 
concomitantly with hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets may exhibit 
an additive CNS depression. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of 
one or both agents should be reduced.
                  The use of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone 
preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or 
hydrocodone.
                  
                  
                  Drug/Laboratory Test InteractionsAcetaminophen may produce false-positive test results for urinary 
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.
                  
                  
                  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of 
FertilityNo adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine 
whether hydrocodone or acetaminophen have a potential for carcinogenesis, 
mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility.
