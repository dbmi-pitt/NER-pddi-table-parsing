                  7.1  Cytochrome P450 Inhibition
                  
                  
                  
                     Strong and Moderate 
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6
                  
                  Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6.
                  Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) 
resulted in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin 
by a factor of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively [
                        see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                        
                     ]. The 
effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., 
erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of FLOMAX have not been evaluated [
                        see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                        
                     ].
                  Concomitant treatment with paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) resulted 
in an increase in the Cmax and AUC of tamsulosin by a 
factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively [
                        see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                        
                     ]. A 
similar increase in exposure is expected in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) as 
compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily 
identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure 
exists when FLOMAX 0.4 mg is co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in 
CYP2D6 PMs, FLOMAX 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [
                        see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                        
                     ]. 
                  The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor 
(e.g., terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of FLOMAX have not been evaluated 
[
                        see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                        
                     ]. 
                  The effects of co-administration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with 
FLOMAX capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for 
significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when FLOMAX 0.4 mg is 
co-administered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors [
                        see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                        
                     ].
                  
                  
                  
                  
                     Cimetidine
                  
                  Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease 
(26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate 
increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) [
                        see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                        
                     ].
                  
                  
                  7.2  Other Alpha Adrenergic Blocking AgentsThe pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between 
FLOMAX capsules and other alpha adrenergic blocking agents have not been 
determined; however, interactions between FLOMAX capsules and other alpha 
adrenergic blocking agents may be expected [
                        see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                        
                     ]. 
                  
                  
                  7.3  PDE5 InhibitorsCaution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents 
including FLOMAX are co-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic 
blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood 
pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause 
symptomatic hypotension [
                        see Warnings 
and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                        
                     ].
                  
                  
                  7.4  WarfarinA definitive drug-drug interaction study between tamsulosin 
hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted. Results from limited 
                        in vitro
                      and 
                        in vivo
                      studies are 
inconclusive. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of 
warfarin and FLOMAX capsules [
                        see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)
                        
                     ].
                  
                  
                  7.5  Nifedipine, Atenolol, EnalaprilDosage adjustments are not necessary when FLOMAX capsules are 
administered concomitantly with nifedipine, atenolol, or enalapril [
                        see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                        
                     ].
                  
                  
                  7.6  Digoxin and TheophyllineDosage adjustments are not necessary when a FLOMAX capsule is 
administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline [
                        see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                        
                     ].
                  
                  
                  7.7  FurosemideFLOMAX capsules had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion 
of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% 
reduction in tamsulosin hydrochloride Cmax and AUC, these 
changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require 
adjustment of the FLOMAX capsules dosage [
                        see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
