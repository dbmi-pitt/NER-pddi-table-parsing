                        When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with ampicillin:
                        Allopurinol - Increased possibility of skin rash; particularly in hyperuricemic patients may occur. 
                        Bacteriostatic antibiotics - Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, sulfonamides, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of penicillins. This has been demonstrated 
         
 
  in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well-documented. 
        

 
                        Oral contraceptives - May be less effective and increased breakthrough bleeding may occur. 
                        Probenecid - May decrease renal tubular secretion of ampicillin resulting in increased blood levels and/or ampicillin toxicity.
