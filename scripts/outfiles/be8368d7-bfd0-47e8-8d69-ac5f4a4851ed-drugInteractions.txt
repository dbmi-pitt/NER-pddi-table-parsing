                        In clinical studies of tobramycin inhalation solution, patients taking tobramycin inhalation solution concomitantly with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME®, Genentech), ß-agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, other anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, or parenteral aminoglycosides demonstrated adverse experience profiles similar to the study population as a whole.

                        Concurrent and/or sequential use of tobramycin inhalation solution with other drugs with neurotoxic, nephrotoxic, or ototoxic potential should be avoided. Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. Tobramycin inhalation solution should not be administered concomitantly with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol. The interaction between inhaled mannitol and tobramycin inhalation solution has not been evaluated.
