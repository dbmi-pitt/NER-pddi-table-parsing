                           Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Do not administer      strong CYP3A4 inducers with irinotecan hydrochloride injection.      (7.2)
                           Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Do not      administer strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with irinotecan hydrochloride      injection. (7.3)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Strong CYP3A4 Inducers
                     
                        Exposure to irinotecan or its active metabolite SN-38 is substantially reduced in adult and pediatric patients concomitantly receiving the CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or St. John's wort. The appropriate starting dose for patients taking these or other strong inducers such as rifampin and rifabutin has not been defined. Consider substituting non-enzyme inducing therapies at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of Irinotecan hydrochloride injection therapy. Do not administer strong CYP3A4 inducers with Irinotecan hydrochloride injection unless there are no therapeutic alternatives.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Strong CYP3A4 or UGT1A1 Inhibitors
                     
                        Irinotecan and its active metabolite, SN-38, are metabolized via the human cytochrome P4503A4 isoenzyme (CYP3A4) and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), respectively, [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Patients receiving concomitant ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibitor, have increased exposure to irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38. Coadministration of Irinotecan hydrochloride injection with other inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, voriconazole) or UGT1A1 (e.g., atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir) may increase systemic exposure to irinotecan or SN-38. Discontinue strong CYP3A4 inhibitors at least 1 week prior to starting Irinotecan hydrochloride injection therapy. Do not administer strong CYP3A4 or UGT1A1 inhibitors with Irinotecan hydrochloride injection unless there are no therapeutic alternatives.
