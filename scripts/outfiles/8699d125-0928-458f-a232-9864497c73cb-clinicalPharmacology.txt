                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Rabeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds (substituted benzimidazole proton-pump inhibitors) that do not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine H -receptor antagonist properties, but suppress gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H , K ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor. Rabeprazole blocks the final step of gastric acid secretion.

                        In gastric parietal cells, rabeprazole is protonated, accumulates, and is transformed to an active sulfenamide. When studied , rabeprazole is chemically activated at pH 1.2 with a half-life of 78 seconds. It inhibits acid transport in porcine gastric vesicles with a half-life of 90 seconds.

                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Antisecretory Activity
                              
                              The antisecretory effect begins within one hour after oral administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets. The median inhibitory effect of Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets on 24 hour gastric acidity is 88% of maximal after the first dose. Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets 20 mg inhibits basal and peptone meal-stimulated acid secretion versus placebo by 86% and 95%, respectively, and increases the percent of a 24-hour period that the gastric pH>3 from 10% to 65% (see table below). This relatively prolonged pharmacodynamic action compared to the short pharmacokinetic half-life (1-2 hours) reflects the sustained inactivation of the H , K ATPase.

Compared to placebo, Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg, administered once daily for 7 days significantly decreased intragastric acidity with all doses for each of four meal-related intervals and the 24-hour time period overall. In this study, there were no statistically significant differences between doses; however, there was a significant dose-related decrease in intragastric acidity. The ability of rabeprazole to cause a dose-related decrease in mean intragastric acidity is illustrated below.
                              


                              


After administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets once daily for eight days, the mean percent of time that gastric pH>3 or gastric pH>4 after a single dose (Day 1) and multiple doses (Day 8) was significantly greater than placebo (see table below). The decrease in gastric acidity and the increase in gastric pH observed with 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets administered once daily for eight days were compared to the same parameters for placebo, as illustrated below:

                              In patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and moderate to severe esophageal acid exposure, Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release 20 mg and 40 mg tablets per day decreased 24-hour esophageal acid exposure. After seven days of treatment, the percentage of time that esophageal pH<4 decreased from baselines of 24.7% for 20 mg and 23.7% for 40 mg, to 5.1% and 2%, respectively. Normalization of 24-hour intraesophageal acid exposure was correlated to gastric pH>4 for at least 35% of the 24-hour period; this level was achieved in 90% of subjects receiving Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets 20 mg and in 100% of subjects receiving Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets 40 mg. With Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets 20 mg and 40 mg per day, significant effects on gastric and esophageal pH were noted after one day of treatment, and more pronounced after seven days of treatment.

                              In patients given daily doses of Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets for up to eight weeks to treat ulcerative or erosive esophagitis and in patients treated for up to 52 weeks to prevent recurrence of disease the median fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner. The group median values stayed within the normal range.
                              In a group of subjects treated daily with Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets 20 mg for 4 weeks a doubling of mean serum gastrin concentrations were observed. Approximately 35% of these treated subjects developed serum gastrin concentrations above the upper limit of normal. In a study of CYP2C19 genotyped subjects in Japan, poor metabolizers developed statistically significantly higher serum gastrin concentrations than extensive metabolizers.

                              Increased serum gastrin secondary to antisecretory agents stimulates proliferation of gastric ECL cells which, over time, may result in ECL cell hyperplasia in rats and mice and gastric carcinoids in rats, especially in females [ ].

                              In over 400 patients treated with Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets (10 or 20 mg/day) for up to one year, the incidence of ECL cell hyperplasia increased with time and dose, which is consistent with the pharmacological action of the proton-pump inhibitor. No patient developed the adenomatoid, dysplastic or neoplastic changes of ECL cells in the gastric mucosa. No patient developed the carcinoid tumors observed in rats.

Patients with persistent infection following rabeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin therapy will likely have clarithromycin resistant clinical isolates. Therefore, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be done when possible. If resistance to clarithromycin is demonstrated or susceptibility testing is not possible, alternative antimicrobial therapy should be instituted.

                        Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets are enteric-coated to allow rabeprazole sodium, which is acid labile, to pass through the stomach relatively intact.
                        After oral administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets, peak plasma concentrations (C ) of rabeprazole occur over a range of 2 to 5 hours (T ). The rabeprazole C and AUC are linear over an oral dose range of 10 mg to 40 mg. There is no appreciable accumulation when doses of 10 mg to 40 mg are administered every 24 hours; the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole is not altered by multiple dosing.

                              : Absolute bioavailability for a 20 mg oral tablet of rabeprazole (compared to intravenous administration) is approximately 52%. When Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets are administered with a high fat meal, T is variable; which concomitant food intake may delay the absorption up to 4 hours or longer. However, the C and the extent of rabeprazole absorption (AUC) are not significantly altered. Thus Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets may be taken without regard to timing of meals.

                              : Rabeprazole is extensively metabolized. A significant portion of rabeprazole is metabolized via systemic nonenzymatic reduction to a thioether compound. Rabeprazole is also metabolized to sulphone and desmethyl compounds via cytochrome P450 in the liver. The thioether and sulphone are the primary metabolites measured in human plasma. These metabolites were not observed to have significant antisecretory activity. studies have demonstrated that rabeprazole is metabolized in the liver primarily by cytochromes P450 3A (CYP3A) to a sulphone metabolite and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to desmethyl rabeprazole. CYP2C19 exhibits a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some sub-populations (e.g. 3 to 5% of Caucasians and 17 to 20% of Asians). Rabeprazole metabolism is slow in these sub-populations, therefore, they are referred to as poor metabolizers of the drug.

                              : Following a single 20 mg oral dose of C-labeled rabeprazole, approximately 90% of the drug was eliminated in the urine, primarily as thioether carboxylic acid; its glucuronide, and mercapturic acid metabolites. The remainder of the dose was recovered in the feces. Total recovery of radioactivity was 99.8%. No unchanged rabeprazole was recovered in the urine or feces.

                              The pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole was studied in 12 adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age, in a multicenter study. Patients received rabeprazole 20 mg tablets once daily for five or seven days. An approximate 40% increase in exposure was noted following 5 to 7 days of dosing compared with the exposure after 1 day dosing. Pharmacokinetic parameters in adolescent patients with GERD 12 to 16 years of age were within the range observed in healthy adult volunteers.
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    : In analyses adjusted for body mass and height, rabeprazole pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences between male and female subjects. In studies that used different formulations of rabeprazole, AUC values for healthy Japanese men were approximately 50-60% greater than values derived from pooled data from healthy men in the United States.

Each of the four regimens was administered twice daily for 6 days. The AUC and C for clarithromycin and amoxicillin were not different following combined administration compared to values following single administration. However, the rabeprazole AUC and C increased by 11% and 34%, respectively, following combined administration. The AUC and C for 14-hydroxyclarithromycin (active metabolite of clarithromycin) also increased by 42% and 46%, respectively. This increase in exposure to rabeprazole and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin is not expected to produce safety concerns.

The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 12% (mean AUC ratio was 88 %, with 90% CI of 81.7 to 95.5%) when Rabeprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets was coadministered compared to administration of clopidogrel with placebo.
