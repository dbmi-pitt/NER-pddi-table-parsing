                  Aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids reduce the peak serum 
levels (rate) but not the AUC (extent) of azithromycin (500 mg) absorption.
                  Administration of cimetidine (800 mg) two hours prior to azithromycin had no 
effect on azithromycin (500 mg) absorption.
                  A single oral dose of 1200 mg azithromycin (2 x 600 mg azithromycin tablets) 
did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single 800 mg oral dose of fluconazole 
in healthy adult subjects.
                  Total exposure (AUC) and half-life of azithromycin following the single oral 
tablet dose of 1200 mg were unchanged and the reduction in Cmax was not significant (mean decrease of 18%) by 
coadministration with 800 mg fluconazole.
                  A single oral dose of 1200 mg azithromycin (2 x 600 mg azithromycin tablets) 
had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of indinavir (800 mg indinavir 
tid for 5 days) in healthy adult subjects.
                  Coadministration of a single oral dose of 1200 mg azithromycin (2 x 600 mg 
azithromycin tablets) with steady-state nelfinavir (750 mg tid) to healthy adult 
subjects produced a decrease of approximately 15% in mean AUC0-8 
of nelfinavir and its M8 metabolite. Mean Cmax of 
nelfinavir and its M8 metabolite were not significantly affected. No dosage 
adjustment of nelfinavir is required when nelfinavir is coadministered with 
azithromycin.
                  Coadministration of nelfinavir (750 mg tid) at steady state with a single 
oral dose of 1200 mg azithromycin increased the mean AUC0-
                     ∞ of azithromycin by approximately a 
factor of 2 times (range of up to 4 times) of that when azithromycin was given 
alone. The mean Cmax of azithromycin was also increased 
by approximately a factor of 2 times (range of up to 5 times) of that when 
azithromycin was given alone. Dose adjustment of azithromycin is not 
recommended. However, when administered in conjunction with nelfinavir, close 
monitoring for known side effects of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme 
abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS.)
                  Following administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole DS (160 mg/800 mg) 
for 7 days to healthy adult subjects, coadministration of 1200 mg azithromycin 
(2 x 600 mg azithromycin tablets) on the 7th day had no 
significant effects on peak concentrations (Cmax), total 
exposure (AUC), and the urinary excretion of either trimethoprim or 
sulfamethoxazole.
                  Coadministration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole DS for 7 days had no 
significant effect on the peak concentration (Cmax) and 
total exposure (AUC) of azithromycin following administration of the single 1200 
mg tablet dose to healthy adult subjects.
                  Administration of a 600 mg single oral dose of azithromycin had no effect on 
the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz given at 400 mg doses for 7 days to healthy 
adult subjects.
                  Efavirenz, when administered at a dose of 400 mg for seven days produced a 
22% increase in the Cmax of azithromycin administered as 
a 600 mg single oral dose, while the AUC of azithromycin was not affected.
                  Azithromycin (500 mg Day 1, 250 mg Days 2 to 5) did not affect the plasma 
levels or pharmacokinetics of theophylline administered as a single intravenous 
dose. The effect of azithromycin on the plasma levels or pharmacokinetics of 
theophylline administered in multiple doses resulting in therapeutic 
steady-state levels of theophylline is not known. However, concurrent use of 
macrolides and theophylline has been associated with increases in the serum 
concentrations of theophylline. Therefore, until further data are available, 
prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of plasma theophylline 
levels in patients receiving azithromycin and theophylline concomitantly.
                  Azithromycin (500 mg Day 1, 250 mg Days 2 to 5) did not affect the 
prothrombin time response to a single dose of warfarin. However, prudent medical 
practice dictates careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patients treated 
with azithromycin and warfarin concomitantly. Concurrent use of macrolides and 
warfarin in clinical practice has been associated with increased anticoagulant 
effects.
                  Dose adjustments are not indicated when azithromycin and zidovudine are 
coadministered. When zidovudine (100 mg q3h x 5) was coadministered with daily 
azithromycin (600 mg, n = 5 or 1200 mg, n = 7), mean Cmax, AUC and Clr increased by 26% (CV 54%), 10% (CV 26%) and 
38% (CV 114%), respectively. The mean AUC of phosphorylated zidovudine increased 
by 75% (CV 95%), while zidovudine glucuronide Cmax and 
AUC increased by less than 10%. In another study, addition of 1 gram 
azithromycin per week to a regimen of 10 mg/kg daily zidovudine resulted in 25% 
(CV 70%) and 13% (CV 37%) increases in zidovudine Cmax 
and AUC, respectively. Zidovudine glucuronide mean Cmax 
and AUC increased by 16% (CV 61%) and 8.0% (CV 32%), respectively.
                  Doses of 1200 mg/day azithromycin for 14 days in 6 subjects increased Cmax of concurrently administered didanosine (200 mg q12h) by 
44% (54% CV) and AUC by 14% (23% CV). However, none of these changes were 
significantly different from those produced in a parallel placebo control group 
of subjects.
                  Preliminary data suggest that coadministration of azithromycin and rifabutin 
did not markedly affect the mean serum concentrations of either drug. 
Administration of 250 mg azithromycin daily for 10 days (500 mg on the first 
day) produced mean concentrations of azithromycin 1 day after the last dose of 
53 ng/mL when coadministered with 300 mg daily rifabutin and 49 mg/mL when 
coadministered with placebo. Mean concentrations 5 days after the last dose were 
23 ng/mL and 21 ng/mL in the two groups of subjects. Administration of 300 mg 
rifabutin for 10 days produced mean concentrations of rifabutin one half day 
after the last dose of 60 mg/mL when coadministered with daily 250 mg 
azithromycin and 71 ng/mL when coadministered with placebo. Mean concentrations 
5 days after the last dose were 8.1 ng/mL and 9.2 ng/mL in the two groups of 
subjects.
                  The following drug interactions have not been reported in clinical trials 
with azithromycin; however, no specific drug interaction studies have been 
performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction. Nonetheless, they have 
been observed with macrolide products. Until further data are developed 
regarding drug interactions when azithromycin and these drugs are used 
concomitantly, careful monitoring of patients is advised:
                  Digoxin–elevated digoxin levels.
                  Ergotamine or dihydroergotamine–acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe 
peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia.
                  Triazolam–decrease the clearance of triazolam and thus may increase the 
pharmacologic effect of triazolam.
                  Drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 
system–elevations of serum carbamazepine, cyclosporine, hexobarbital, and 
phenytoin levels.
