Drug Interactions
Catecholamine-depleting drugs (eg, reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with TENORMIN plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope or postural hypotension.   Calcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with TENORMIN (see WARNINGS).WARNINGS).Beta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.  If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine.  If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers.Caution should be exercised with TENORMIN I.V. Injection when given in close proximity with drugs that may also have a depressant effect on myocardial contractility. On rare occasions, concomitant use of intravenous beta blockers and intravenous verapamil has resulted in serious adverse reactions, especially in patients with severe cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, or recent myocardial infarction.  Information on concurrent usage of atenolol and aspirin is limited.  Data from several studies, ie, TIMI-II, ISIS-2, currently do not suggest any clinical interaction between aspirin and beta blockers in the acute myocardial infarction setting. While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic.  Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction.
