                     7.1   Ergot-Containing Drugs Including Other 5-HT1B/1D Agonists
                     
                        Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine [DHE] or methysergide) and RELPAX within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. Concomitant use of other 5-HT1 agonists within 24 hours of RELPAX treatment is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2    CYP3A4 Inhibitors
                     
                        Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors significantly increase the exposure of RELPAX. Relpax should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3   Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome
                     
                        Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
