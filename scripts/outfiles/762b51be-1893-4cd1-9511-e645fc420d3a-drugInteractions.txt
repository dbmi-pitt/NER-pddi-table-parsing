                  No formal drug-interaction studies have been performed, and a clinically significant interaction with other medications used in the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure cannot be excluded based on the available data. INOmax has been administered with dopamine, dobutamine, steroids, surfactant, and high-frequency ventilation. Although there are no study data to evaluate the possibility, nitric oxide donor compounds, including sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerin, may have an additive effect with INOmax on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia. An association between prilocaine and an increased risk of methemoglobinemia, particularly in infants, has specifically been described in a literature case report. This risk is present whether the drugs are administered as oral, parenteral, or topical formulations.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Nitric oxide donor agents: Nitric oxide donor compounds, such as prilocaine, sodium nitroprusside, and nitroglycerin, when administered as oral, parenteral, or topical formulations, may have an additive effect with INOmax on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia (7).
