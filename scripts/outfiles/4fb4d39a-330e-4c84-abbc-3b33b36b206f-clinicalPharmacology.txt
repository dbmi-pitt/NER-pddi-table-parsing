                  The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, based on sulfonamides acting as a competitive inhibitor of paraminobenzoic acid (PABA) utilization, an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin in humans has not been determined, in vitro studies with human cadaver skin indicated a percutaneous absorption of about 4%. Sulfacetamide sodium is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine largely unchanged. The biological half-life has been reported to be between 7 to 13 hours.
                  The pharmacokinetics of sulfacetamide and its major metabolite sulfanilamide in sulfacetamide sodium lotion was evaluated in adult subjects (N=14) with acne vulgaris. The subjects applied sulfacetamide sodium lotion to their face, back, chest and shoulders every 12 hours for 28 days. The percentage of the applied dose of sulfacetamide sodium lotion excreted in the urine as sulfacetamide plus sulfanilamide ranged from 0.08 to 0.33%.
