                        Some drugs for injection may be incompatible in a given vehicle, or when combined in the same vehicle or in a vehicle containing benzyl alcohol.
                        Consult with pharmacist, if available.  Use aseptic technique for entry and withdrawal from all containers.
                        When diluting or dissolving drugs, mix thoroughly and use promptly.
                        Do not store reconstituted solutions of drugs for injection unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer of the solute.
                        Do not use unless the solution is clear and seal intact. Do not reuse single dose containers, discard unused portion.
