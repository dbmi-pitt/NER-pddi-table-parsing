                  Phenazopyridine hydrochloride is excreted in the urine where it exerts a topical analgesic effect on the mucosa of the urinary tract. This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is unknown.

                        The pharmacokinetic properties of phenazopyridine hydrochloride have not been determined. Phenazopyridine and its metabolites are rapidly excreted by the kidneys. In a small number of healthy subjects, 90% of a 600 mg/day oral dose of phenazopyridine hydrochloride was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours, 41% as unchanged drug and 49% as metabolites.
