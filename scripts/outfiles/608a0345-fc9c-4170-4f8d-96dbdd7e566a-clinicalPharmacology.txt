                  Lorazepam interacts with the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine        receptor complex, which is widespread in the brain of humans as well as other species. This        interaction is presumed to be responsible for lorazepam’s mechanism of action.        Lorazepam exhibits relatively high and specific affinity for its recognition site but does        not displace GABA. Attachment to the specific binding site enhances the affinity of GABA for        its receptor site on the same receptor complex. The pharmacodynamic consequences of        benzodiazepine agonist actions include antianxiety effects, sedation, and reduction of        seizure activity. The intensity of action is directly related to the degree of benzodiazepine        receptor occupancy.
                  
                     
                        Effects in Pre-Operative Patients
                     
                  
                  Intravenous or intramuscular administration of the recommended dose of 2 mg to 4 mg        of lorazepam injection to adult patients is followed by dose-related effects of sedation        (sleepiness or drowsiness), relief of preoperative anxiety, and lack of recall of events        related to the day of surgery in the majority of patients. The clinical sedation (sleepiness        or drowsiness) thus noted is such that the majority of patients are able to respond to simple        instructions whether they give the appearance of being awake or asleep. The lack of recall is        relative rather than absolute, as determined under conditions of careful patient questioning        and testing, using props designed to enhance recall. The majority of patients under these        reinforced conditions had difficulty recalling perioperative events or recognizing props from        before surgery. The lack of recall and recognition was optimum within 2 hours        following intramuscular administration and 15 to 20 minutes after intravenous injection.
                  The intended effects of the recommended adult dose of lorazepam injection usually        last 6 to 8 hours. In rare instances and where patients received greater than the        recommended dose, excessive sleepiness and prolonged lack of recall were noted. As with other        benzodiazepines, unsteadiness, enhanced sensitivity to CNS-depressant effects of ethyl        alcohol and other drugs were noted in isolated and rare cases for greater than 24 hours.
                  
                     
                        Physiologic Effects in Healthy Adults
                     
                  
                  Studies in healthy adult volunteers reveal that intravenous lorazepam in doses up        to 3.5 mg/70 kg does not alter sensitivity to the respiratory stimulating effect of carbon        dioxide and does not enhance the respiratory depressant effects of doses of meperidine up to        100 mg/70 kg (also determined by carbon dioxide challenge) as long as patients remain        sufficiently awake to undergo testing. Upper airway obstruction has been observed in rare        instances where the patient received greater than the recommended dose and was excessively        sleepy and difficult to arouse. (See 
                        WARNINGS
                      and 
                        ADVERSE REACTIONS
                     .)
                  Clinically employed doses of lorazepam injection do not greatly affect the        circulatory system in the supine position or employing a 70-degree tilt test. Doses of 8 mg        to 10 mg of intravenous lorazepam (2 to 2-1/2 times the maximum recommended dosage) will        produce loss of lid reflexes within 15 minutes.
                  Studies in six (6) healthy young adults who received lorazepam injection and no        other drugs revealed that visual tracking (the ability to keep a moving line centered) was        impaired for a mean of eight (8) hours following administration of 4 mg of intramuscular        lorazepam and four (4) hours following administration of 2 mg intramuscularly with        considerable subject variation. Similar findings were noted with pentobarbital, 150 and 75        mg. Although this study showed that both lorazepam and pentobarbital interfered with eye-hand        coordination, the data are insufficient to predict when it would be safe to operate a motor        vehicle or engage in a hazardous occupation or sport.

                  Following intramuscular administration, lorazepam is completely and rapidly        absorbed reaching peak concentrations within 3 hours. A 4-mg dose provides a Cmax        of approximately 48 ng/mL. Following administration of 1.5 to 5 mg of lorazepam IM, the        amount of lorazepam delivered to the circulation is proportional to the dose administered.
                  
                     
                        Distribution/Metabolism/Elimination
                     
                  
                  At clinically relevant concentrations, lorazepam is 91 ± 2% bound to        plasma proteins; its volume of distribution is approximately 1.3 L/kg. Unbound lorazepam        penetrates the blood/brain barrier freely by passive diffusion, a fact confirmed by CSF        sampling. Following parenteral administration, the terminal half-life and total clearance        averaged 14 ± 5 hours and 1.1 ± 0.4 mL/min/kg,        respectively.
                  Lorazepam is extensively conjugated to the 3-O-phenolic glucuronide in the liver        and is known to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Lorazepam-glucuronide is an inactive        metabolite and is eliminated mainly by the kidneys.
                  Following a single 2-mg oral dose of 14C-lorazepam to 8 healthy        subjects, 88 ± 4% of the administered dose was recovered in urine and 7 ±        2% was recovered in feces. The percent of administered dose recovered in urine as        lorazepam-glucuronide was 74 ± 4%. Only 0.3% of the dose was recovered as unchanged        lorazepam, and the remainder of the radioactivity represented minor metabolites.

                  There is no information on the pharmacokinetic profile of lorazepam in infants in        the age range of 1 month to 2 years.

                  Total (bound and unbound) lorazepam had a 50% higher mean volume of distribution        (normalized to body-weight) and a 30% longer mean half-life in children with acute        lymphocytic leukemia in complete remission (2 to 12 years, n=37) compared to normal adults        (n=10). 
                        Unbound
                      lorazepam clearance normalized to        body-weight was comparable in children and adults.

                        Unbound
                      lorazepam clearance        normalized to body-weight was comparable in adolescents and adults.

                  Following single intravenous doses of 1.5 to 3 mg of Lorazepam Injection, mean        total body clearance of lorazepam decreased by 20% in 15 elderly subjects of 60 to 84 years        of age compared to that in 15 younger subjects of 19 to 38 years of age. Consequently, no        dosage adjustment appears to be necessary in elderly subjects based solely on their age.

                  Gender has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam.

                  Young Americans (n=15) and Japanese subjects (n=7) had very comparable mean total        clearance value of 1.0 mL/min/kg. However, elderly Japanese subjects had a 20% lower mean        total clearance than elderly Americans, 0.59 mL/min/kg vs 0.77 mL/min/kg, respectively.
                  
                     
                        Patients with Renal Insufficiency
                     
                  
                  Because the kidney is the primary route of elimination of lorazepam-glucuronide,        renal impairment would be expected to compromise its clearance. This should have no direct        effect on the glucuronidation (and inactivation) of lorazepam. There is a possibility that        the enterohepatic circulation of lorazepam-glucuronide leads to a reduced efficiency of the        net clearance of lorazepam in this population.
                  Six normal subjects, six patients with renal impairment (Clcr of 22        ± 9 mL/min), and four patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis were given single        1.5 to 3.0 mg intravenous doses of lorazepam. Mean volume of distribution and terminal        half-life values of lorazepam were 40% and 25% higher, respectively, in renally impaired        patients than in normal subjects. Both parameters were 75% higher in patients undergoing        hemodialysis than in normal subjects. Overall, though, in this group of subjects the mean        total clearance of lorazepam did not change. About 8% of the administered intravenous dose        was removed as intact lorazepam during the 6-hour dialysis session.
                  The kinetics of lorazepam-glucuronide were markedly affected by renal dysfunction.        The mean terminal half-life was prolonged by 55% and 125% in renally impaired patients and        patients under hemodialysis, respectively, as compared to normal subjects. The mean metabolic        clearance decreased by 75% and 90% in renally impaired patients and patients under        hemodialysis, respectively, as compared to normal subjects. About 40% of the administered        lorazepam intravenous dose was removed as glucuronide conjugate during the 6-hour dialysis        session.

                  Because cytochrome oxidation is not involved with the metabolism of lorazepam,        liver disease would not be expected to have an effect on metabolic clearance. This prediction        is supported by the observation that following a single 2 mg intravenous dose of lorazepam,        cirrhotic male patients (n=13) and normal male subjects (n=11) exhibited no substantive        difference in their ability to clear lorazepam.

                  Administration of a single 2 mg intravenous dose of lorazepam showed that there was        no difference in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of lorazepam between cigarette smokers        (n=10, mean=31 cigarettes per day) and nonsmoking subjects (n=10) who were matched        for age, weight, and gender.
