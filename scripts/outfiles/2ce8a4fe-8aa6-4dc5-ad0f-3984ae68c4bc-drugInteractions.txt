                           LIDOCAINE PATCH 5% should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic.

                           When LIDOCAINE PATCH 5% is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered.
