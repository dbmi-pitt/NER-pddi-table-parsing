                  Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and 
cortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement 
therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs, such as 
prednisone, are primarily used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in 
disorders of many organ systems.
                  Glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, cause profound and varied metabolic 
effects. In addition, they modify the body’s immune response to diverse stimuli.
