                              Strong and moderate CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors: Increase exposure to PLETAL.

                           Inhibitors of CYP3A4
                        
                        Coadministration of strong (e.g., ketoconazole) and moderate (e.g., erythromycin, diltiazem and grapefruit juice) CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase exposure to PLETAL. Reduce PLETAL dose to 50 mg twice daily when coadministered with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                        
                           Inhibitors of CYP2C19
                        
                        Coadministration with CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) increases systemic exposure of PLETAL active metabolites. Reduce PLETAL dose to 50 mg twice daily when coadministered with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
