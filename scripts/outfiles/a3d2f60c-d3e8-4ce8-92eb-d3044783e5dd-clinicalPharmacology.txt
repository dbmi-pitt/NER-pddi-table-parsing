                  Bacitracin, an antibiotic substance derived from cultures of 
                        Bacillus licheniformis
                      exerts pronounced antibacterial action 
                        in vitro
                      against a variety of gram-positive and a few gram-negative organisms.  However, among systemic diseases, only staphylococcal infections qualify for consideration of bacitracin therapy.  Bacitracin is assayed against a standard and its activity is expressed in units, 1 mg having a potency of not less than 50 units.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Susceptibility plate testing

                     
                     
                        If the Kirby-Bauer method of disk susceptibility is used, a 10 unit bacitracin disk should give a zone of over 13 mm when tested against a bacitracin-susceptible strain of 
                              Staphylococcus aureus
                           .  Absorption of bacitracin following intramuscular injection is rapid and complete.  A dose of 200 or 300 units/kg every 6 hours gives serum levels of 0.2 to 2 mcg/mL in individuals with normal renal function.  The drug is excreted slowly by glomerular filtration.  It is widely distributed in all body organs and is demonstrable in ascitic and pleural fluids after intramuscular injection.
