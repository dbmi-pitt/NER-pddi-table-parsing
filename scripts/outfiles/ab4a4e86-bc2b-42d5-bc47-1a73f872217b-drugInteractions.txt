                        Morphine should be administered cautiously and in reduced dosage to avoid additive effects when other central nervous system depressants, including other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothlazines, tricyclic antidepressants, tranquilizers or alcohol, are given concomitantly.

                           
Virtually all drug interactions involving MAO inhibitors and narcotic analgesics have been reported with meperidine, which is contraindicated in such patients. In patients receiving MAO inhibitors, therefore, before initiating therapy with other narcotic analgesics, including morphine, an initial small test dose is advisable to allow observation of excessive narcotic effects or MAOI interaction.
