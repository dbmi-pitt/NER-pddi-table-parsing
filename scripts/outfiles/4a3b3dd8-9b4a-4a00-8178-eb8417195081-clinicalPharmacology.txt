                                 Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis retain                             phosphorus and can develop hyperphosphatemia. High serum phosphorus can                             precipitate serum calcium resulting in ectopic calcification. When the                             product of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations (Ca x P) exceeds                             55 mg2/dL2, there is an increased risk that                             ectopic calcification will occur. Hyperphosphatemia plays a role in the                             development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal insufficiency.             
                  Treatment of hyperphosphatemia includes reduction in dietary                             intake of phosphate, inhibition of intestinal phosphate absorption with                             phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate with dialysis. Renagel taken                             with meals has been shown to decrease serum phosphorus concentrations in                             patients with CKD who are on dialysis.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Renagel contains sevelamer hydrochloride, a non-absorbed                                     binding crosslinked polymer. It contains multiple amines                                     separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines                                     exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with                                     phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By                                     binding phosphate in the dietary tract and decreasing                                     absorption, sevelamer hydrochloride lowers the phosphate                                     concentration in the serum.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                                           In addition to effects on serum phosphate levels,                                     sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids                                         
                              in vitro
                            and 
                              in vivo
                            in experimental animal models. Bile acid binding by                                     ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering                                     blood cholesterol. Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may                                     interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce                                     absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K. In                                     clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total                                     and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%. This effect is                                     observed after 2 weeks. Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and                                     albumin did not change.

                                           A mass balance study using 14C-sevelamer                                     hydrochloride in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed                                     that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed. No                                     absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal                                     disease.
