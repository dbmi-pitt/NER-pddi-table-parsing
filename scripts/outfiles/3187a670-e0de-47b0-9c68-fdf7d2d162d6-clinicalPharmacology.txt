CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Meperidine hydrochloride is a narcotic analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine; the most
							prominent of these involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation.There is some evidence which suggests that meperidine may produce less smooth muscle spasm, constipation, and depression of the
							cough reflex than equianalgesic doses of morphine. Meperidine, in 60 mg to 80 mg parenteral doses, is approximately equivalent in analgesic effect to 10 mg of morphine. The onset of
							action is slightly more rapid than with morphine, and the duration of action is slightly shorter. Meperidine is significantly less effective by the oral than by the parenteral route, but
							the exact ratio of oral to parenteral effectiveness is unknown.Meperidine is metabolized through biotransformation. The elimination half-life is 3 to 8 hours in healthy volunteers and is 1.3 to
							2 times greater in postoperative or cirrhotic patients. The only bioactive metabolite is normeperidine which has an average elimination half-life of 20.6 hours. Elevated serum levels
							have been reported to cause central nervous system excitatory effects.
