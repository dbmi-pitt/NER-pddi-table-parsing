                           Drug Interactions
                           
                              When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with ampicillin:
                              Allopurinol: Increased possibility of skin rash, particularly in hyperuricemic patients may occur. 
                              Bacteriostatic Antibiotics: Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, sulfonamides, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of penicillins. This has been demonstrated in view, however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented. 
                              Oral Contraceptives: May be less effective and increased breakthrough bleeding may occur. 
                              Probenecid: May decrease renal tubular secretion of ampicillin resulting in increased blood levels and/or ampicillin toxicity. 
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions
                           
                              After treatment with ampicillin, a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper sulfate tests (Benedict's solution, Fehling's solution, or Clinitest tablets) but not with enzyme based tests such as Clinistix® and Tes-Tape® (Glucose Enzymatic Test Strip USP).
