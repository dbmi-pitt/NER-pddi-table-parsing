                           Acyclovir 
                           
                              Plasma concentrations of meperidine and its metabolite, normeperidine, may be increased by acyclovir, thus caution should be used with concomitant administration.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Cimetidine 
                           
                              Cimetidine reduced the clearance and volume of distribution of meperidine and also the formation of the metabolite, normeperidine, in healthy subjects and thus, caution should be used with concomitant administration.
                              
                                 CNS Depressants: Concomitant use of CNS depressants with usual doses of meperidine HCl may result in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma or death (see 
                                    PRECAUTIONS, Interactions with other CNS Depressants
                                 ).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Phenytoin 
                           
                              The hepatic metabolism of meperidine may be enhanced by phenytoin. Concomitant administration resulted in reduced half-life and bioavailability with increased clearance of meperidine in healthy subjects, however, blood concentrations of normeperidine were increased, thus exercise caution when phenytoin is used concomitantly with meperidine.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Ritonavir 
                           
                              Plasma concentrations of the active metabolite normeperidine may be increased by ritonavir, thus concomitant administration should be avoided.
                              Opioid analgesics, including meperidine HCl, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.
