                  Patients who receive epinephrine while concomitantly taking cardiac glycosides, diuretics, or anti-arrhythmics should be observed carefully for the development of cardiac arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)
                     ].
                  The effects of epinephrine may be potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, levothyroxine sodium, and certain antihistamines, notably chlorpheniramine, tripelennamine, and diphenhydramine.
                  The cardiostimulating and bronchodilating effects of epinephrine are antagonized by beta- adrenergic blocking drugs, such as propranolol.
                  The vasoconstricting and hypertensive effects of epinephrine are antagonized by alpha- adrenergic blocking drugs, such as phentolamine.
                  Ergot alkaloids may also reverse the pressor effects of epinephrine.
