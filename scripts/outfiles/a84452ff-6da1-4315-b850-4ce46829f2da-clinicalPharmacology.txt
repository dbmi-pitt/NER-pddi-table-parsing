Trihexyphenidyl HCl is the substituted piperidine salt, 3-(1-piperidyl)-1-phenylcyclohexyl-1-propanol hydrochloride, which exerts a direct inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetis nervous system. It also has relaxing effect on smooth musculature; exerted both directly upon the muscle tissue itself and indirectly through an inhibitory effect upon the parasympathetic nervous system. Its therapeutic properties are similar to those of atropine, although undesirable side effects are ordinarily less frequent and severe than with the latter.
