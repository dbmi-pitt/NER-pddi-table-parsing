                        Medications for an overactive thyroid (anti-thyroid drugs) used in conjunction with iodine supplementation may lead to hypothyroidism.
                        Medications for hypertension used in conjunction with iodine supplementation may increase potassium.
                        High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of the anticonvulsant drugs carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, phenytoin, phenobarbitol, and valproic acid. Folic acid may decrease a patient's response to methotrexate. 
                        Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones.

                        Consult appropriate references for additional specific vitamin-drug interactions.
