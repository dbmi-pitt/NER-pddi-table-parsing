                  Dibenzyline (phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride) is a long-acting, adrenergic, alpha-receptor-blocking
agent, which can produce and maintain "chemical sympathectomy" by oral administration. It increases blood flow to the skin, mucosa and abdominal
viscera, and lowers both supine and erect blood pressures.  It has no effect
on the parasympathetic system. 
                  Twenty to 30 percent of orally administered phenoxybenzamine appears to be absorbed in the active
form.¹
                  The half-life of orally administered
phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride is not known; however, the half-life of intravenously
administered drug is approximately 24 hours.  Demonstrable effects with intravenous
administration persist for at least 3 to 4 days, and the effects of daily
administration are cumulative for nearly a week.¹
