                           Potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.1)
                           
                           Synergistic effect expected when given concurrently with succinylcholine, other cholinesterase inhibitors, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.2)
                           
                        
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Use with Anticholinergics
                     
                        Galantamine has the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Use With Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors
                     
                        A synergistic effect is expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, other cholinesterase inhibitors, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
