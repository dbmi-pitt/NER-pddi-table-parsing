                           Moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin): Limit RANEXA to 500 mg twice daily. ( )

                           P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine): Ranolazine exposure increased. Titrate RANEXA based on clinical response. ( )

                           CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with RANEXA.  Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may need to be reduced with RANEXA. ( )
                                        7.2
                           
                           OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to 1700 mg daily when used with RANEXA 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2 substrates may require adjusted doses. ( )

                           Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses when used with RANEXA. ( )

                              Limit the dose of RANEXA to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole, and grapefruit juice or grapefruit-containing products

                              Concomitant use of RANEXA and P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may result in increases in ranolazine concentrations.  Titrate RANEXA based on clinical response in patients concomitantly treated with predominant P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine

                              Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on any dose of RANEXA to 20 mg once daily, when ranolazine is co-administered. Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as RANEXA may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs .

                              Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted

                              The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with RANEXA, and lower doses of these drugs may be required.

                              In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of RANEXA 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When RANEXA 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day. Monitor blood glucose levels and risks associated with high exposures of metformin. Metformin exposure was not significantly increased when given with RANEXA 500 mg twice daily
