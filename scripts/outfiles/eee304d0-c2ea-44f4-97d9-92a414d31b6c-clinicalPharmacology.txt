                        Ribavirin is an antiviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

                        Multiple dose ribavirin pharmacokinetic data are available for HCV patients who received ribavirin in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a. Following administration of 1200 mg/day with food for 12 weeks mean±SD (n=39; body weight greater than 75 kg) AUC0-12 hr was 25,361±7110 ng·hr/mL and Cmax was 2748±818 ng/mL. The average time to reach Cmax was 2 hours. Trough ribavirin plasma concentrations following 12 weeks of dosing with food were 1662±545 ng/mL in HCV infected patients who received 800 mg/day (n=89), and 2112±810 ng/mL in patients who received 1200 mg/day (n=75; body weight greater than 75 kg).

                           
The terminal half-life of ribavirin following administration of a single oral dose of ribavirin is about 120 to 170 hours. The total apparent clearance following administration of a single oral dose of ribavirin is about 26 L/h. There is extensive accumulation of ribavirin after multiple dosing (twice daily) such that the Cmax at steady state was four-fold higher than that of a single dose.

                           
                              
Effect of Food on Absorption of Ribavirin

                           
                           
Bioavailability of a single oral dose of ribavirin was increased by coadministration with a high-fat meal. The absorption was slowed (Tmax was doubled) and the AUC0-192 h and Cmax increased by 42% and 66%, respectively, when ribavirin was taken with a high-fat meal compared with fasting conditions [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

                           
                              
Elimination and Metabolism

                           
                           
The contribution of renal and hepatic pathways to ribavirin elimination after administration of ribavirin is not known. In vitro studies indicate that ribavirin is not a substrate of CYP450 enzymes.

                           
                              
Renal Impairment

                           
                           
A clinical trial evaluated 50 CHC subjects with either moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring chronic hemodialysis (HD). The apparent clearance of ribavirin was reduced in subjects with creatinine clearance less than or equal to 50 mL/min, including subjects with ESRD on HD, exhibiting approximately 30% of the value found in subjects with normal renal function. Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation indicates that a dose of 200 mg daily in patients with severe renal impairment and a dose of 200 mg daily alternating with 400 mg the following day in patients with moderate renal impairment will provide plasma ribavirin exposures similar to that observed in patients with normal renal function receiving the standard 1000/1200 mg ribavirin daily dose. These doses have not been studied in patients. 

                           
In 18 subjects with ESRD receiving chronic HD, ribavirin was administered at a dose of 200 mg daily. Ribavirin plasma exposures in these subjects were approximately 20% lower compared to subjects with normal renal function receiving the standard 1000/1200 mg ribavirin daily dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 

                           
Plasma ribavirin is removed by hemodialysis with an extraction ratio of approximately 50%; however, due to the large volume of distribution of ribavirin, plasma exposure is not expected to change with hemodialysis.

                           Mechanism of Action
                           

                           
The mechanism by which ribavirin contributes to its antiviral efficacy in the clinic is not fully understood. Ribavirin has direct antiviral activity in tissue culture against many RNA viruses. Ribavirin increases the mutation frequency in the genomes of several RNA viruses and ribavirin triphosphate inhibits HCV polymerase in a biochemical reaction.
                              

                              
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture 
 

                           In the stable HCV cell culture model system (HCV replicon), ribavirin inhibited autonomous HCV RNA replication with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) value of 11 to 21 mcM. In the same model, PEG-IFN α-2a also inhibited HCV RNA replication, with an EC50 value of 0.1 to 3 ng/mL. The combination of PEG-IFN α-2a and ribavirin was more effective at inhibiting HCV RNA replication than either agent alone.
                              

                              
Resistance 
 

                           Different HCV genotypes display considerable clinical variability in their response to PEG-IFN-α and ribavirin therapy. Viral genetic determinants associated with the variable response have not been definitively identified.

                           
                              
Cross-resistance
 

                           Cross-resistance between IFN α and ribavirin has not been observed.
