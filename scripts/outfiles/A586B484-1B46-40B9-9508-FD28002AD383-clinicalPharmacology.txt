CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of testosterone. Certain clinical effects and adverse reactions demonstrate the androgenic properties of this class of drugs. Complete dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effects has not been achieved. The actions of anabolic steroids are therefore similar to those of male sex hormones with the possibility of causing serious disturbances of growth and sexual development if given to young children. Anabolic steroids suppress the gonadotropic functions of the pituitary and may exert a direct effect upon the testis.Anabolic steroids have been reported to increase low-density lipoproteins and decrease high-density lipoproteins. These changes revert to normal on discontinuation of treatment.
