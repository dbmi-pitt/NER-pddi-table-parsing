                  Drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted. Women who take a warfarin anticoagulant and use a miconazole intravaginal cream or suppository may be at risk for developing an increased prothrombin time, international normalized ratio (INR), and bleeding. The potential for this interaction between warfarin and VUSION is unknown.
