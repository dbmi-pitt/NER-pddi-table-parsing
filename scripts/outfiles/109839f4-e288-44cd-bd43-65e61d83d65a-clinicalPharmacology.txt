                  The allergic state is initiated by an immune response inducing B cells to produce IgE antibodies to specific allergens. IgE antibodies bind to surface receptors on mast cells and basophils. When antigens gain access to the immune system they react with the bound IgE. The reacting antigen to the surface bound IgE stimulates a number of chemical mediators to be released from the mast cells and basophils. These include histamine, Eosinophil Chemotactic Factor (ECF-A) and leukotrienes. These chemical mediators are pharmacologically active at low concentrations and are partially responsible for the biological manifestation of the allergic response. (3)
                  The mechanism by which immunotherapy achieves hyposensitization is not completely understood. There is an increase in 'blocking antibody" (IgG) titer and in some patients a decrease in specific IgE, a decrease in histamine release to specific allergen and an increase in suppressor cell population to specific allergen. These changes may occur only after prolonged therapy. (4)
