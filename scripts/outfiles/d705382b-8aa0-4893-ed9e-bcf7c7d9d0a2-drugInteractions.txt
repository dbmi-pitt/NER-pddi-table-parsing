                        Prior administration of succinylcholine may enhance the neuromuscular
blocking effect of pancuronium and increase its duration of action. If succinylcholine
is used before pancuronium bromide, the administration of pancuronium bromide
should be delayed until the patient starts recovering from succinylcholine-induced
neuromuscular blockade.
                        If a small dose of pancuronium
bromide is given at least 3 minutes prior to the administration of succinylcholine,
in order to reduce the incidence and intensity of succinylcholine-induced
fasciculations, this dose may induce a degree of neuromuscular block sufficient
to cause respiratory depression in some patients.
                        Other
nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (vecuronium, atracurium, d-tubocurarine,
metocurine, and gallamine) behave in a clinically similar fashion to pancuronium
bromide. The combination of pancuronium bromide-metocurine and pancuronium
bromide-d-tubocurarine are significantly more potent than the additive effects
of each of the individual drugs given alone, however, the duration of blockade
of these combinations is not prolonged. There are insufficient data to support
concomitant use of pancuronium and the other three above mentioned muscle
relaxants in the same patient.
