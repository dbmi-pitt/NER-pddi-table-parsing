                  For the concurrent therapy of either cyclosporine, fibrates, niacin (nicotinic acid), or erythromycin, the risk of myopathy increases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (
                           12.3
                        )].
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Fibrates: use with fibrate products may increase the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. (2.4, 5.1) 
                           Cyclosporine: combination increases exposure. Limit pravastatin to 20 mg once daily. (2.5, 7.1) 
                           Clarithromycin: combination increases exposure. Limit pravastatin to 40 mg once daily. (2.6, 7.2)
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Cyclosporine
                     
                        The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant administration of cyclosporine. Limit pravastatin to 20 mg once daily for concomitant use with cyclosporine [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (
                                 12.3
                              )].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Clarithromycin
                     
                        The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant administration of clarithromycin. Limit pravastatin to 40 mg once daily for concomitant use with clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (
                                 12.3
