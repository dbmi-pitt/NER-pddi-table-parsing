                        Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
                        Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin.
                        Absorption of tetracycline is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
                        Absorption of tetracycline is impaired by bismuth subsalicylate.
                        Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline.
                        The concurrent use of tetracycline and Penthrane® (methoxyflurane) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.
                        Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective.
