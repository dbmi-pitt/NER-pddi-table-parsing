                           Anticoagulants (oral)
                           
                              Due to potential inhibition of vitamin K activity by methimazole, the activity of oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) may be increased; additional monitoring of PT/INR should be considered, especially before surgical procedures.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           β-adrenergic blocking agents
                           
                              Hyperthyroidism may cause an increased clearance of beta blockers with a high extraction ratio. A dose reduction of beta-adrenergic blockers may be needed when a hyperthyroid patient becomes euthyroid.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Digitalis glycosides
                           
                              Serum digitalis levels may be increased when hyperthyroid patients on a stable digitalis glycoside regimen become euthyroid; a reduced dosage of digitalis glycosides may be needed.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Theophylline
                           
                              Theophylline clearance may decrease when hyperthyroid patients on a stable theophylline regimen become euthyroid; a reduced dose of theophylline may be needed.
