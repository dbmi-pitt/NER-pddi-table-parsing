Some trials with omega-3-acids demonstrated prolongation of bleeding time. The prolongation of
  

bleeding time reported in these trials has not exceeded normal limits and did not produce clinically
  

significant bleeding episodes. Clinical trials have not been done to thoroughly examine the effect of
  

omega-3-acid ethyl esters and concomitant anticoagulants. Patients receiving treatment with omega-3-
  

acid ethyl esters and an anticoagulant or other drug affecting coagulation (e.g., anti-platelet agents)
  

should be monitored periodically.
