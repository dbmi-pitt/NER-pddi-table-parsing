                     Drugs That May Increase Risks Due to Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities
                     
                        Use caution when prescribing Colyte for patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizures, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Consider additional patient evaluations as appropriate (see Precautions) in patients taking these concomitant medications.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Potential for Altered Drug Absorption
                     
                        Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of administration of Colyte may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract and the medication may not be absorbed properly.
