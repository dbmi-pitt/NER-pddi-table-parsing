Ciclopirox is a broad-spectrum, antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of 
pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts, and Malassezia 
furfur. Ciclopirox exhibits fungicidal activity in 
vitro against isolates of Trichophyton rubrum, 
Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermorphyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, and 
Candida albicans.

                     

                  
                  Pharmacokinetic studies in men with tagged ciclopirox solution in 
polyethylene glycol 400 showed an average of 1.3% absorption of the dose when it 
was applied topically to 750 cm2 on the back followed by 
occlusion for 6 hours. The biological half-life was 1.7 hours and excretion 
occurred via the kidney. Two days after application only 0.01% of the dose 
applied could be found in the urine. Fecal excretion was negligible.
                  

                  Penetration studies in human cadaverous skin from the back, with ciclopirox 
olamine cream, USP with tagged ciclopirox showed the presence of 0.8 to 1.6% of 
the dose in the stratum corneum 1.5 to 6 hours after application. The levels in 
the dermis were still 10 to 15 times above the minimum inhibitory 
concentrations.
                  

                  Autoradiographic studies with human cadaverous skin showed that ciclopirox 
penetrates into the hair and through the epidermis and hair follicles into the 
sebaceous glands and dermis, while a portion of the drug remains in the stratum 
corneum.
                  Draize Human Sensitization Assay, 21-Day Cumulative Irritancy study, 
Phototoxicity study, and Photo-Draize study conducted in a total of 142 healthy 
subjects showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, 
no irritation, no phototoxicity, and no photo-contact sensitization due to 
ciclopirox olamine cream, USP.
