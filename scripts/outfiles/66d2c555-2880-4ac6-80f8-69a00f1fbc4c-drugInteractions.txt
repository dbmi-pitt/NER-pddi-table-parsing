                              Oral Anticoagulants
                           
                           
                              
                                 CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN COUMARIN ANTICOAGULANTS ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH FENOFIBRATE. THE DOSAGE OF THE ANTICOAGULANTS SHOULD BE REDUCED TO MAINTAIN THE PROTHROMBIN TIME/INR AT THE DESIRED LEVEL TO PREVENT BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS. FREQUENT PROTHROMBIN TIME/INR DETERMINATIONS ARE ADVISABLE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY DETERMINED THAT THE PROTHROMBIN TIME/INR HAS STABILIZED.
                              
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors
                           
                           
                              The combined use of fenofibrate and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination (see WARNINGS).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Resins
                           
                           
                              Since bile acid sequestrants may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take fenofibrate at least one hour before or 4 to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Cyclosporine
                           
                           
                              Because cyclosporine can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs including fenofibrate, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration. The benefits and risks of using fenofibrate with immunosuppressants and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered and the lowest effective dose employed.
