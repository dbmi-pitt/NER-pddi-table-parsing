                        DRUG INTERACTIONS

                           
- CNS depressants: Increased risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma or death. When combined therapy with CNS depressant is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. (7.2)
- Mixed agonist/antagonist opioids (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol): May reduce analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.3)
- Cimetidine: Combination use may precipitate confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures. (7.4)
- Anticholinergics: May result in urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. (7.5)
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Potentiate the action of opioids. OPANA ER should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.6)
- Dose adjustment for CYP3A450 or 2C9-mediated drug-drug interactions is not required. (7.1)
