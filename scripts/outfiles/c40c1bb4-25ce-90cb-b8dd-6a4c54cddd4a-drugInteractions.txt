                     In vitro data indicate that levocetirizine is unlikely to produce pharmacokinetic interactions through inhibition or induction of liver drug-metabolizing enzymes.  No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with levocetirizine.  Drug interaction studies have been performed with racemic cetirizine.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Antipyrine, Azithromycin, Cimetidine, Erythromycin, Ketoconazole, Theophylline, and Pseudoephedrine
                     
                        Pharmacokinetic interaction studies performed with racemic cetirizine demonstrated that cetirizine did not interact with antipyrine, pseudoephedrine, erythromycin, azithromycin, ketoconazole, and cimetidine.  There was a small decrease (∼16%) in the clearance of cetirizine caused by a 400 mg dose of theophylline.  It is possible that higher theophylline doses could have a greater effect.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 	Ritonavir
                     
                        Ritonavir increased the plasma AUC of cetirizine by about 42% accompanied by an increase in half-life (53%) and a decrease in clearance (29%) of cetirizine.  The disposition of ritonavir was not altered by concomitant cetirizine administration.
