                  Methylphenidate is a mild central nervous system stimulant.
                  The mode of action in man is not completely understood, but methylphenidate 
presumably activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce its 
stimulant effect.
                  There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism 
whereby methylphenidate produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, 
nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of 
the central nervous system.
                  Methylphenidate hydrochloride in the extended-release tablets is more slowly 
but as extensively absorbed as in the regular tablets. Relative bioavailability 
of the extended-release tablet compared to the methylphenidate hydrochloride 
tablet, measured by the urinary excretion of methylphenidate hydrochloride major 
metabolite (α-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid) was 105% (49%-168%) in children 
and 101% (85%-152%) in adults. The time to peak rate in children was 4.7 hours 
(1.3-8.2 hours) for the extended-release tablets and 1.9 hours (0.3-4.4 hours) 
for the tablets. An average of 67% of extended-release tablet dose was excreted 
in children as compared to 86% in adults.
                  In a clinical study involving adult subjects who received extended-release 
tablets, plasma concentrations of methylphenidate hydrochloride’s major 
metabolite appeared to be greater in females than in males. No gender 
differences were observed for methylphenidate hydrochloride plasma concentration 
in the same subjects.
