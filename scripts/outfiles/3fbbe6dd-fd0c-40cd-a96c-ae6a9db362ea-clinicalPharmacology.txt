                        Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF is an osmotic agent which causes water to be retained with the stool. Essentially, complete recovery of Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF was shown in normal subjects without constipation. Attempts at recovery of Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF in constipated patients resulted in incomplete and highly variable recovery. In vitro study showed indirectly that Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF was not fermented into hydrogen or methane by the colonic microflora in human feces. Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF appears to have no effect on the active absorption or secretion of glucose or electrolytes. There is no evidence of tachyphylaxis.
