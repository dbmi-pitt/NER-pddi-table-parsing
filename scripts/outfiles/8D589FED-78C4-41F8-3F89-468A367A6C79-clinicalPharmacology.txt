CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
In a study of 10 patients with angiographically normal or
minimally stenosed (less than 25% luminal diameter narrowing) coronary vessels,
dipyridamole in a dose of 0.56 mg/kg infused over 4 minutes resulted
in an average fivefold increase in coronary blood flow velocity compared to
resting coronary flow velocity (range 3.8 to 7 times resting velocity). The
mean time to peak flow velocity was 6.5 minutes from the start of the 4-minute
infusion (range 2.5 to 8.7 minutes). Cardiovascular responses to the intra
venous administration of dipyridamole when given to patients in the supine
position include a mild but significant increase in heart rate of approximately
20% and mild but significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood
pressure of approximately 2 to 8%, with vital signs returning to baseline
values in approximately 30 minutes.Mechanism
of Action: Dipyridamole is a coronary vasodilator in man. The mechanism
of vasodilation has not been fully elucidated, but may result from inhibition
of uptake of adenosine, an important mediator of coronary vasodilation. The
vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole are abolished by administration of the
adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline.Mechanism

vasodilation leads to abnormalities in thallium distribution and ventricular
function is also uncertain but presumably represents a “steal”
phenomenon in which relatively intact vessels dilate, and sustain enhanced
flow, leaving reduced pressure and flow across areas of hemodynamically important
coronary vascular constriction.Pharmacokinetics
and Metabolism: Plasma dipyridamole concentrations decline in a
triexponential fashion following intravenous infusion of dipyridamole, with
half-lives averaging 3 to 12 minutes, 33 to 62 minutes, and 11.6 to 15
hours. Two minutes following a 0.568 mg/kg dose of intravenous dipyridamole
administered as a 4-minute infusion, the mean dipyridamole serum concentration
is 4.6±1.3 mcg/mL. The average plasma protein binding of dipyridamole
is approximately 99%, primarily to α1 -glycoprotein. Dipyridamole
is metabolized in the liver to the glucuronic acid conjugate and excreted
with the bile. The average total body clearance is 2.3 to 3.5 mL/min/kg,
with an apparent volume of distribution at steady state of 1 to 2.5 L/kg and
a central apparent volume of  3 to 5 liters.Pharmacokinetics
