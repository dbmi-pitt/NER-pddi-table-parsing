                        Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporin antibiotics. Concomitant administration of probenecid doubled the AUC for cefprozil.
                        The bioavailability of the capsule formulation of cefprozil was not affected when administered 5 minutes following an antacid.
