                  pHisoHex is a bacteriostatic cleansing agent.  It cleanses the skin thoroughly and has bacteriostatic action against staphylococci and other gram-positive bacteria.  Cumulative antibacterial action develops with repeated use. Cleansing with alcohol or soaps containing alcohol removes the antibacterial residue.
                  Detectable blood levels of hexachlorophene following absorption through intact skin have been found in subjects who regularly scrubbed with hexachlorophene emulsion 3%.  (See WARNINGS for additional information.)
                  pHisoHex has the same slight acidity as normal skin (pH value 5.0 to 6.0).
