                           Antacids and kaolin
                           
                              Antacids and kaolin can reduce the absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Cimetidine
                           
                              Cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of chloroquine, increasing its plasma level. Concomitant use of cimetidine should be avoided.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Ampicillin
                           
                              In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin. An interval of at least two hours between intake of this agent and chloroquine should be observed.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Cyclosporin
                           
                              After introduction of chloroquine (oral form), a sudden increase in serum cyclosporin level has been reported. Therefore, close monitoring of serum cyclosporin level is recommended and, if necessary, chloroquine should be discontinued.
