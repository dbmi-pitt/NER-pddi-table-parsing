                  Primidone raises electro- or chemoshock seizure thresholds or alters seizure patterns in experimental animals. The mechanisms(s) of primidone’s antiepileptic action is not known.
                  Primidone per se has anticonvulsant activity as do its two metabolites, phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA). In addition to its anticonvulsant activity, PEMA potentiates the anticonvulsant activity of phenobarbital in experimental animals.
