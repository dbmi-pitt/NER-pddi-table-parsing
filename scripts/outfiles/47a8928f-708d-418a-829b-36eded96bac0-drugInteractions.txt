                              Probenecid may decrease renal tubular secretion of cephalosporins when used concurrently, resulting in increased and more prolonged cephalosporin blood levels.

                              A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with Benedict’s solution, Fehling’s solution or with Clinitest® tablets, but not with enzyme-based tests such as Clinistix®.
                              Positive direct and indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) tests have occurred; these may also occur in neonates whose mothers received cephalosporins before delivery.
