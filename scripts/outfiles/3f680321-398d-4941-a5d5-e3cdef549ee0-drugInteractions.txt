                  No specific cytochrome P-450-based drug interaction studies have
                            been conducted. No pharmacokinetic interaction between
                                85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil
                            (5-FU)/leucovorin (LV)  has been observed in patients treated
                            every 2 weeks. Increases of 5-FU plasma concentrations by approximately
                            20% have been observed with doses of 130 mg/m2
                            oxaliplatin dosed every 3 weeks. Because platinum-containing
                            species are eliminated primarily through the kidney, clearance of these
                            products may be decreased by coadministration of potentially nephrotoxic
                            compounds; although, this has not been specifically studied
