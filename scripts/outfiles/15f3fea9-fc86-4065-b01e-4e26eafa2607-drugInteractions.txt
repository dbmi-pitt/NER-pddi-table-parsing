            Drug InteractionsThe CNS-depressant effect of propoxyphene is additive with that of other CNS depressants, including alcohol.As is the case with many medicinal agents, propoxyphene may slow the metabolism of a concomitantly administered drug. Shouldthis occur, the higher serum concentrations of that drug may result in increased pharmacologic or adverse effects of that drug. Suchoccurrences have been reported when propoxyphene was administered to patients on antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or warfarin-likedrugs. Severe neurologic signs, including coma, have occurred with concurrent use of carbamazepine.
