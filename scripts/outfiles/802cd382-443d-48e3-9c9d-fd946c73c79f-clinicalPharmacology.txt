                     12.1	Mechanism of Action
                     
                        The mechanism of action of diclofenac is similar to that of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Diclofenac inhibits the enzyme, cyclooxygenase (COX), an early component of the arachidonic acid cascade, resulting in the reduced formation of prostaglandins, thromboxanes and prostacylin. It is not completely understood how reduced synthesis of these compounds results in therapeutic efficacy.

                                 Absorption:
                              
                              After administration of PENNSAID topical solution (40 mg/knee every 12 h; total daily diclofenac exposure: 80 mg/knee) for 7.5 days, the  mean  (SD)  AUC0-12  and  mean  (SD)  Cmax  were 77.27 (49.89) ng∙h/mL and 12.16 (7.66) ng/mL, respectively, on Day 1; and 204.58 (111.02) ng∙h/mL and 25.24 (12.95) ng/mL, respectively, at steady state on Day 8. After administration of PENNSAID  1.5%  topical  solution  (19.3  mg/knee  every  6  h;  total  daily  diclofenac  exposure 77.2 mg/knee), the mean (SD) AUC0-12 and mean  (SD)  Cmax  were  27.46  (23.97)  ng∙h/mL  and 2.30 (2.02) ng/mL, respectively, on Day 1; and 141.49 (92.47) ng∙h/mL and 17.04 (11.28) ng/mL, respectively, at steady state on Day 8.
                              The pharmacokinetics and effect of PENNSAID were not evaluated under the conditions of heat application, occlusive dressings overlay, or exercise following product application. Therefore, concurrent use of PENNSAID under these conditions is not recommended.

                              Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin.
                              Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac.

                              Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac.

                              Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites.
                              Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine.
