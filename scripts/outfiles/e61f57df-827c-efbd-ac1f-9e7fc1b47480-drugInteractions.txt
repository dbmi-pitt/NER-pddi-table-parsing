                           Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: As noted above (“Derangements of Serum Electrolytes”), the net effect of quinapril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be to elevate a patient’s serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient’s serum potassium should be monitored frequently.
                        
                           Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with quinapril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor.
                        Quinapril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.
                        
                           Tetracycline and Other Drugs That Interact with Magnesium: Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium.
                        
                           Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy.
                        
                           Other Agents: 
                        
                        Drug interaction studies of quinapril and other agents showed:
                        
                           Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril.
                           The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice daily.
                           Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.
                           No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly.
                        
                        When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics.
                        
                           Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics—potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.
                           Antidiabetic Drugs (oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin)—dosage adjustments of the antidiabetic drug may be required.
                           Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resin—absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively.
                           Corticosteroids, ACTH—intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia.
                           Pressor Amines (eg, norepinephrine)—possible decreased response to pressor amines, but not sufficient to preclude their therapeutic use.
                           Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (eg, tubocurarine)—possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant.
                           Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs—the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents.
