                  Like other topical corticosteroids, halobetasol propionate has 
anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of 
the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids, in general, is 
unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of 
phospholipase A2, inhibitory proteins, collectively 
called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the 
biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and 
leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic 
acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase 
A2.
               
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids 
is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the 
epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours 
have not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of 
hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical 
corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or 
other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.
                        Human and animal studies indicate that less than 6% of the applied dose of 
halobetasol propionate enters the circulation within 96 hours following topical 
administration of the cream.
                        Studies performed with halobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% indicate that it 
is in the super-high range of potency as compared with other topical 
corticosteroids.
