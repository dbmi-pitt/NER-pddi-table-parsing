                           Codeine:
                           
                              In patients receiving MAO inhibitors, an initial small test dose is advisable to allow observation of any excessive narcotic effects of MAOI interaction.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Promethazine:
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 CNS depressants
                                 
                                    Promethazine may increase, prolong, or intensify the sedative action of other central-nervous-system depressants, such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients receiving promethazine HCl. When given concomitantly with promethazine, the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one-half, and the dose of narcotics should be reduced by one-quarter to one-half. Dosage must be individualized. Excessive amounts of promethazine HCl relative to a narcotic may lead to restlessness and motor hyperactivity in the patient with pain; these symptoms usually disappear with adequate control of the pain.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 Epinephrine
                                 
                                    Because of the potential for promethazine to reverse epinephrine’s vasopressor effect, epinephrine should NOT be used to treat hypotension associated with promethazine overdose.
                                 
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 Anticholinergics
                                 
                                    Concomitant use of other agents with anticholinergic properties should be undertaken with caution.

                                    Drug interactions, including an increased incidence of extrapyramidal effects, have been reported when some MAOI and phenothiazines are used concomitantly.
