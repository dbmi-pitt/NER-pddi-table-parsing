Drug Interactions
Animal studies indicate that dobutamine may be ineffective
if the patient has recently received a ß-blocking drug. In such a case,
the peripheral vascular resistance may increase.Preliminary
studies indicate that the concomitant use of dobutamine and nitroprusside
results in a higher cardiac output and, usually, a lower pulmonary wedge pressure
than when either drug is used alone.There was no evidence
of drug interactions in clinical studies in which dobutamine was administered
concurrently with other drugs, including digitalis preparations, furosemide,
spironolactone, lidocaine, nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate, morphine,
atropine, heparin, protamine, potassium chloride, folic acid, and acetaminophen.
