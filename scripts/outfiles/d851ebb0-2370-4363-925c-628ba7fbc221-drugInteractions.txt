                           Stavudine
                        
                        Concomitant use of zidovudine with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship has been demonstrated in vitro.
                        
                           Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication
                        
                        Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided.

                        Concomitant use of zidovudine with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship has been demonstrated in vitro.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents
                     
                        Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine.
