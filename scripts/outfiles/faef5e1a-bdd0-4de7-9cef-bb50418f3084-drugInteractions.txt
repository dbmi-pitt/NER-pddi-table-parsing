                        Absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with anticholinergics due to decreased gastrointestinal motility and delayed gastric emptying.
                        Drug interactions may occur when anticholinergics are used with the following medications: antacids, antidiarrheals (adsorbent), other anticholinergics, antimyasthenics, cyclopropane, haloperidol, ketoconazole, metoclopramide, opioid (narcotic) analgesics, and potassium chloride.
