Meperidine
                            hydrochloride is a narcotic analgesic with multiple actions
                            qualitatively similar to those of morphine; the most prominent of these
                            involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle.
                            The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation.There is some
                            evidence which suggests that meperidine may produce less smooth muscle
                            spasm, constipation and depression of the cough reflex than
                            equianalgesic doses of morphine. Meperidine, in 60 to 80 mg parenteral
                            doses, is approximately equivalent in analgesic effect to 10 mg of
                            morphine. The onset of action is slightly more rapid than with morphine,
                            and the duration of action is slightly shorter. Meperidine is
                            significantly less effective by the oral than by the parenteral route,
                            but the exact ratio of oral to parenteral effectiveness is unknown.In clinical
                            studies, changes in several pharmacokinetic parameters with increasing
                            age have been observed. The initial volume of distribution and
                            steady-state volume of distribution may be higher in elderly patients
                            than in younger patients.1 The free fraction of meperidine in
                            plasma may be higher in patients over 45 years of age than in younger
                                patients.21 The free fraction of meperidine in
