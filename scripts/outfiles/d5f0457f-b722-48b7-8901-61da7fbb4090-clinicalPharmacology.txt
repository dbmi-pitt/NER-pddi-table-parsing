In animals, Trazodone HCl selectively inhibits its serotonin uptake by brain synaptosomes and potentiates the behavioral changes induced by the serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan. Cardiac conduction effects of Trazodone HCl in the anesthetized dog are qualitatively dissimilar and quantitatively less pronounced than those seen with tricyclic antidepressants. Trazodone HCl is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and, unlike amphetamine type drugs, does not stimulate the central nervous system.
