                        Co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) increases paricalcitol blood levels.

                     7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors
                     
                        Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Paricalcitol blood levels will be increased when paricalcitol is co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, monitor both PTH and serum calcium more frequently and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose as required [see
