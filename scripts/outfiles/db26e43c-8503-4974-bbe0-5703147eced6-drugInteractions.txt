                     7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs
                     
                        Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and naratriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Other 5-HT1 Agonists
                     
                        Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of treatment with naratriptan is     contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome
                     
                        Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
