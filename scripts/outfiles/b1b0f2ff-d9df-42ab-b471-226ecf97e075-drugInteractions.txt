                           Do not use methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients currently using or within 2 weeks of using an MAO inhibitor. (7.1) 
                           Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase blood pressure; use cautiously with vasopressors. (7.2) 
                           Inhibition of metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, and some antidepressants (7.3) 
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 MAO Inhibitors
                     
                        Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used in patients being treated (currently or within the preceding 2 weeks) with MAO inhibitors [see Contraindications (4.5)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Vasopressor Agents
                     
                        Because of possible increases in blood pressure, methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be used cautiously with vasopressor agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Coumarin Anticoagulants, Antidepressants, and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors
                     
                        Human pharmacologic studies have shown that methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone), and some antidepressants (tricyclics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Downward dose adjustment of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with methylphenidate. It may be necessary to adjust the dosage and monitor plasma drug concentrations (or, in the case of coumarin, coagulation times), when initiating or discontinuing concomitant methylphenidate.
