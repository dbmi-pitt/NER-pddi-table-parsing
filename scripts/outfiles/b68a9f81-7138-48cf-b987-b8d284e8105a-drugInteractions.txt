                           In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Acetaminophen
                                 
Tizanidine delayed the Tmax of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Alcohol
                                 
Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20% while also increasing its Cmax by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 Oral Contraceptives
                                 
 No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and tizanidine, but retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of 4 mg tizanidine showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine than women not on oral contraceptives.
