                  Methscopolamine bromide is an anticholinergic agent which possesses most of the pharmacologic actions of that drug class. These include reduction in volume and total acid content of gastric secretion, inhibition of gastrointestinal motility, inhibition of salivary excretion, dilation of the pupil and inhibition of accommodation with resulting blurring of vision. Large doses may result in tachycardia.

                        Methscopolamine bromide is a quaternary ammonium derivative of scopolamine. As a class, these agents are poorly and unreliably absorbed.1,2 Total absorption of quaternary ammonium derivatives of the alkaloids is 10-25%. Rate of absorption is not available. Quaternary ammonium salts have limited absorption from intact skin, and conjunctival penetration is poor.1 Little is known of the fate and excretion of most of these agents.1 Following oral administration, drug effects appear in about one hour and persist for 4 to 6 hours. 2 Methscopolamine bromide has limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.3,4,5 The drug is excreted primarily in the urine and bile, or as unabsorbed drug in feces.2 There is no data on the presence of methscopolamine in breast milk; traces of atropine have been found after administration of atropine.1
