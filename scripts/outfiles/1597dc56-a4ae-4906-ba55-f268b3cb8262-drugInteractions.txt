                        Acetaminophen: Flumadine, 100 mg, was given twice daily for 13 days to 12 healthy volunteers. On day 11, acetaminophen (650 mg four times daily) was started and continued for 8 days. The pharmacokinetics of rimantadine were assessed on days 11 and 13. Coadministration with acetaminophen reduced the peak concentration and AUC values for rimantadine by approximately 11%.
                        Aspirin: Flumadine, 100 mg, was given twice daily for 13 days to 12 healthy volunteers. On day 11, aspirin (650 mg, four times daily) was started and continued for 8 days. The pharmacokinetics of rimantadine were assessed on days 11 and 13. Peak plasma concentrations and AUC of rimantadine were reduced approximately 10% in the presence of aspirin.
                        Cimetidine: When a single 100 mg dose of Flumadine was administered with steady-state cimetidine (300 mg four times a day), there were no statistically significant differences in rimantadine Cmax or AUC between Flumadine alone and Flumadine in the presence of cimetidine.
                        Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV): The concurrent use of Flumadine® with live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine has not been evaluated. However, because of potential interference between these products, the live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine should not be administered until 48 hours after cessation of Flumadine® and Flumadine® should not be administered until two weeks after the administration of live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine unless medically indicated. The concern about potential interference arises principally from the potential for antiviral drugs to inhibit replication of live vaccine virus.
