                  Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be affected significantly by CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (Figure 1). Dose adjustments are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Guanfacine does not significantly affect exposures of methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine when coadministered (Figure 2). Therefore, no dose adjustments in methylphenidate or lisdexamfetamine are necessary.

                            Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): Coadministration increases guanfacine exposure. Guanfacine dose should be limited to no more than 2 mg/day. When discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, guanfacine dose should be doubled based on patient tolerability. The maximum dose should not exceed 4 mg/day (2.7 and 7).
                            Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin): Coadministration decreases guanfacine exposure. Guanfacine dose may be titrated up to 8 mg/day. When discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers, guanfacine dose should be decreased by half in 1 to 2 weeks based on patient tolerability. The maximum dose should not exceed 4 mg/day (2.7 and 7).
