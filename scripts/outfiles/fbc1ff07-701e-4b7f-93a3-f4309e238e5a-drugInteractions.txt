                              Insulin requirements may be increased by medications with hyperglycemic
activity such as corticosteroids, isoniazid, certain lipid-lowering drugs
(e.g., niacin), estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, and thyroid
replacement therapy.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           
                              Insulin requirements may be decreased in the presence of drugs that increase insulin sensitivity or have hypoglycemic
activity, such as oral antidiabetic agents, salicylates, sulfa antibiotics,
certain antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors), angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, beta-adrenergic blockers,
inhibitors of pancreatic function (e.g., octreotide), and alcohol. Beta–adrenergic
blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia in some patients.
