It also concentrates in the choroid plexus, thyroid gland, salivary glands, and stomach.  However, in contrast to the iodide ion, the pertechnetate ion is released unchanged from the thyroid gland.
                  After intravascular administration the pertechnetate ion gradually equilibrates with the extracellular space.  A fraction is promptly excreted via the kidneys.
                  Following the administration of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection as an eye drop, the drug mixes with tears within the conjunctival space.  Within seconds to minutes it leaves the conjunctival space and escapes into the inferior meatus of the nose through the nasolacrimal drainage system.  During this process the pertechnetate ion passes through the canaliculi, the lacrimal sac and the nasolacrimal duct.  In the event of any anatomical or functional blockage of the drainage system there will be a backflow resulting in tearing (epiphora).  Thus the pertechnetate escapes the conjunctival space in the tears.
                  While the major part of the pertechnetate escapes within a few minutes of normal drainage and tearing, it has been documented that there is some degree of transconjunctival absorption with a fractional turnover rate of 0.015/min in normal individuals, 0.021/min in patients without any sac and 0.027/min in patients with inflamed conjunctiva due to chronic dacryocystitis.  Individual values may vary but these rates are probably representative and indicate that the maximum possible pertechnetate absorbed will remain below one thousandth of that used in other routine diagnostic procedures.
