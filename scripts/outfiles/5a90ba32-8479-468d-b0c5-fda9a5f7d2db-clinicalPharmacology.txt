                  Mechanism of Action and Pharmacodynamic 
PropertiesClopidogrel is a prodrug, one of whose metabolites is an 
inhibitor of platelet aggregation. A variety of drugs that inhibit platelet 
function have been shown to decrease morbid events in people with established 
cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease as evidenced by stroke or transient 
ischemic attacks, myocardial infarction, unstable angina or the need for 
vascular bypass or angioplasty. This indicates that platelets participate in the 
initiation and/or evolution of these events and that inhibiting platelet 
function can reduce the event rate.
                  Clopidogrel must be metabolized by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active 
metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation. The active metabolite of 
clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to 
its platelet P2Y12 receptor and the subsequent 
ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby 
inhibiting platelet aggregation. This action is irreversible. Consequently, 
platelets exposed to clopidogrel's active metabolite are affected for the 
remainder of their lifespan (about 7 to 10 days). Platelet aggregation induced 
by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of 
platelet activation by released ADP.
                  Because the active metabolite is formed by CYP450 enzymes, some of which are 
polymorphic or subject to inhibition by other drugs, not all patients will have 
adequate platelet inhibition. 
                  Dose dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after 
single oral doses of PLAVIX. Repeated doses of 75 mg PLAVIX per day inhibit 
ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady 
state between Day 3 and Day 7. At steady state, the average inhibition level 
observed with a dose of 75 mg PLAVIX per day was between 40% and 60%. Platelet 
aggregation and bleeding time gradually return to baseline values after 
treatment is discontinued, generally in about 5 days.
                  
                  Pharmacokinetics
                  AbsorptionAfter single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, 
clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Mean peak plasma levels of unchanged 
clopidogrel (approximately 2.2-2.5 ng/mL after a single 75-mg oral dose) 
occurred approximately 45 minutes after dosing. Absorption is at least 50%, 
based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel metabolites.
                  
                  Effect of FoodThe effect of food on the bioavailability of the parent compound 
or active metabolite is currently not known.
                  
                  DistributionClopidogrel and the main circulating inactive metabolite bind 
reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 
94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in 
vitro up to a concentration of 100 mcg/mL.
                  
                  MetabolismClopidogrel is extensively metabolized by the liver. In vitro and in vivo, 
clopidogrel is metabolized according to two main metabolic pathways: one 
mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into its inactive carboxylic 
acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites), and one mediated by multiple 
cytochromes P450. Cytochromes first oxidize clopidogrel to a 2-oxo-clopidogrel 
intermediate metabolite. Subsequent metabolism of the 2-oxo-clopidogrel 
intermediate metabolite results in formation of the active metabolite, a thiol 
derivative of clopidogrel. In vitro, this metabolic 
pathway is mediated by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. The active thiol 
metabolite, which has been isolated in vitro, binds 
rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet 
aggregation.
                  
                  EliminationFollowing an oral dose of 14C-labeled 
clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% of total radioactivity was excreted in 
urine and approximately 46% in feces over the 5 days post-dosing. After a 
single, oral dose of 75 mg, clopidogrel has a half-life of approximately 6 
hours. The elimination half-life of the inactive acid metabolite was 8 hours 
after single and repeated administration. Covalent binding to platelets 
accounted for 2% of radiolabel with a half-life of 11 days. In plasma and urine, 
the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.
                  
                  
                  PharmacogeneticsSeveral polymorphic CYP450 enzymes activate clopidogrel. CYP2C19 
is involved in the formation of both the active metabolite and the 
2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. Clopidogrel active metabolite 
pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet effects, as measured by ex 
vivo platelet aggregation assays, differ according to CYP2C19 genotype. 
The CYP2C19*1 allele corresponds to fully functional metabolism while the 
CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 alleles correspond to reduced metabolism. The CYP2C19*2 
and CYP2C19*3 alleles account for 85% of reduced function alleles in whites and 
99% in Asians. Other alleles associated with reduced metabolism include 
CYP2C19*4, *5, *6, *7, and *8, but these are less frequent in the general 
population. Published frequencies for the common CYP2C19 phenotypes and 
genotypes are listed in the table below.
                  To date, the impact of CYP2C19 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of 
clopidogrel's active metabolite has been evaluated in 227 subjects from 7 
reported studies. Reduced CYP2C19 metabolism in intermediate and poor 
metabolizers decreased the Cmax and AUC of the active 
metabolite by 30-50% following 300- or 600 mg loading doses and 75 mg 
maintenance doses. Lower active metabolite exposure results in less platelet 
inhibition or higher residual platelet reactivity. To date, diminished 
antiplatelet responses to clopidogrel have been described for intermediate and 
poor metabolizers in 21 reported studies involving 4,520 subjects. The relative 
difference in antiplatelet response between genotype groups varies across 
studies depending on the method used to evaluate response, but is typically 
greater than 30%.
                  The association between CYP2C19 genotype and clopidogrel treatment outcome 
was evaluated in 2 post-hoc clinical trial analyses (substudies of CLARITY-TIMI 
281 [n=465] and 
TRITON-TIMI 382 
[n=1,477]) and 5 cohort studies (total n=6,489). In CLARITY-TIMI 28 and one of 
the cohort studies (n=765; Trenk3), cardiovascular event rates did not differ 
significantly by genotype. In TRITON-TIMI 38 and 3 of the cohort studies (n= 
3,516; Collet,4 
Sibbing,5 Giusti6), patients with an 
impaired metabolizer status (intermediate and poor combined) had a higher rate 
of cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) or stent 
thrombosis compared to extensive metabolizers. In the fifth cohort study 
(n=2,208; Simon7), 
the increased event rate was observed only in poor metabolizers. 
                  Pharmacogenetic testing can identify genotypes associated with variability in 
CYP2C19 activity.
                  There may be genetic variants of other CYP450 enzymes with effects on the 
ability to form clopidogrel's active metabolite.

                  Special PopulationsThe pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel's active metabolite is not 
known in these special populations.
                  
                  Geriatric PatientsIn elderly (≥75 years) volunteers compared to young healthy 
volunteers, there were no differences in platelet aggregation and bleeding time. 
No dosage adjustment is needed for the elderly.
                  
                  Renally-Impaired PatientsAfter repeated doses of 75 mg PLAVIX per day in patients with 
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 5 to 15 mL/min), inhibition 
of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was lower (25%) than that observed in 
healthy volunteers, however, the prolongation of bleeding time was similar to 
healthy volunteers receiving 75 mg of PLAVIX per day. 
                  
                  Hepatically-Impaired PatientsAfter repeated doses of 75 mg PLAVIX per day for 10 days in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet 
aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy subjects. The mean bleeding 
time prolongation was also similar in the two groups.
                  
                  GenderIn a small study comparing men and women, less inhibition of 
ADP-induced platelet aggregation was observed in women, but there was no 
difference in prolongation of bleeding time. In the large, controlled clinical 
study (Clopidogrel vs. Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events; CAPRIE), 
the incidence of clinical outcome events, other adverse clinical events, and 
abnormal clinical laboratory parameters was similar in men and women.
                  
                  RaceThe prevalence of CYP2C19 alleles that result in intermediate and 
poor CYP2C19 metabolism differs according to race/ethnicity (see
