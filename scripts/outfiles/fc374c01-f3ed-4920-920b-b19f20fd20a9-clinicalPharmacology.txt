                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection is used to replete the body content of iron. Iron is critical for normal hemoglobin synthesis to maintain oxygen transport. Additionally, iron is necessary for metabolism and various enzymatic processes.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics
                     
                        Multiple sequential single dose intravenous pharmacokinetic studies were performed on 14 healthy iron-deficient volunteers. Entry criteria included hemoglobin >10.5 gm/dL and transferrin saturation <15% (TSAT) or serum ferritin value <20 ng/mL. In the first stage, each subject was randomized 1:1 to undiluted sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection of either 125 mg/hr or 62.5 mg/0.5 hr (2.1 mg/min). Five days after the first stage, each subject was re-randomized 1:1 to undiluted sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection of either 125 mg/7 min or 62.5 mg/4 min (>15.5 mg/min). 
                        Peak drug levels (Cmax) varied significantly by dosage and by rate of administration with the highest Cmax observed in the regimen in which 125 mg was administered in 7 minutes (19.0 mg/L). The terminal elimination half-life for drug bound iron was approximately 1 hour. Half-life varied by dose but not by rate of administration. Half-life values were 0.85 and 1.45 hours for the 62.5 mg/4 min and 125 mg/7 min regimens, respectively. Total clearance of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection was 3.02 to 5.35 L/h. The AUC for sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection bound iron varied by dose from 17.5 mg-h/L (62.5 mg) to 35.6 mg-h/L (125 mg). Approximately 80% of drug bound iron was delivered to transferrin as a mononuclear ionic iron species within 24 hours of administration in each dosage regimen. Direct movement of iron from sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection to transferrin was not observed. Mean peak transferrin saturation returned to near baseline by 40 hours after administration of each dosage regimen. 
                        
                           Pediatrics: Single dose intravenous pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 48 iron-deficient pediatric hemodialysis patients. Twenty-two patients received 1.5 mg/kg sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection and 26 patients received 3.0 mg/kg sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection (maximum dose 125 mg). The mean Cmax, AUC0-
                           ∞, and terminal elimination half-life values following a 1.5 mg/kg dose were 12.9 mg/L, 95.0 mg•hr/L, and 2.0 hours, respectively. The mean Cmax, AUC0-
                           ∞, and terminal elimination half-life values following a 3.0 mg/kg dose were 22.8 mg/L, 170.9 mg•hr/L, and 2.5 hours, respectively.
                        
                           In vitro experiments have shown that less than 1% of the iron species within sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection can be dialyzed through membranes with pore sizes corresponding to 12,000 to 14,000 daltons over a period of up to 270 minutes. Human studies in renally competent patients suggest the clinical insignificance of urinary excretion.
