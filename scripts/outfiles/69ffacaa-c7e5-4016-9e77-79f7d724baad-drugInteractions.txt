                        Other sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators or epinephrine should not be used concomitantly with albuterol.
                        Albuterol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, since the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated.
                        Beta-receptor blocking agents and albuterol inhibit the effect of each other.
