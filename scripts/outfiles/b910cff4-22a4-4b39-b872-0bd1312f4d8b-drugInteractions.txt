                  Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 
isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when OTFC 
is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant 
use of OTFC with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, 
erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased 
fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects 
including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving OTFC concomitantly 
with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an 
extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively.
                  Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood 
concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided.
                  Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite 
effects.
                  Concomitant use of OTFC with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of 
discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings And Precautions (5.9)].
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Monitor patients who begin or end therapy with potent inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 
for signs of opioid toxicity. (5.4, 7)
