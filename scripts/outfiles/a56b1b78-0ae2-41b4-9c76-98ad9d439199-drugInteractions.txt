                   Based on 
                        in vitro
                      data, plerixafor is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of human
                     cytochrome P450 isozymes. Plerixafor is not likely to be implicated in 
                        in vivo
                      drug-drug interactions involving cytochrome P450s. At concentrations
                     similar to what are seen clinically, plerixafor did not act as a substrate or
                     inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in an 
                        in vitro
                      study.
