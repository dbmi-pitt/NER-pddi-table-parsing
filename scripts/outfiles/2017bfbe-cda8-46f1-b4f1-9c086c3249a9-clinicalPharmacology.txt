                  As the resin passes along the intestine or is retained in the colon after administration by enema, the sodium ions are partially released and are replaced by potassium ions.  For the most part, this action occurs in the large intestine, which excretes potassium ions to a greater degree than does the small intestine.  The efficiency of this process is limited and unpredictably variable.  It commonly approximates the order of 33 percent but the range is so large that definitive indices of electrolyte balance must be clearly monitored.
