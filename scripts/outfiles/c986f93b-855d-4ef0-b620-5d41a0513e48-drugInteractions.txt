                  Leptin is a cytokine and may have the potential to alter the
                            formation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. This should be taken into
                            account when prescribing concomitant drugs metabolized by CYP450 (e.g.,
                            oral contraceptives and drugs with a narrow therapeutic index). The
                            effect of metreleptin on CYP450 enzymes may be clinically relevant for
                            CYP450 substrates with narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is
                            individually adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of MYALEPT, in
                            patients being treated with these types of agents, therapeutic
                            monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g.,
                            cyclosporine or theophylline) should be performed and the individual
                            dose of the agent adjusted as needed.
