                  This anticholinergic preparation blocks the responses of the sphincter muscle of the iris and the ciliary muscle to cholinergic stimulation, dilating the pupil (mydriasis). The stronger preparation (1%) also paralyzes accommodation. This preparation acts in 15-30 minutes, and the duration of activity is approximately 3-8 hours. Complete recovery from mydriasis in some individuals may require 24 hours. The weaker strength may be useful in producing mydriasis with only slight cycloplegia. Heavily pigmented irides may require more doses than lightly pigmented irides.
