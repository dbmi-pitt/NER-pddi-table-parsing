                           BECAUSE THE MAJOR ELIMINATION PATHWAY FOR GANCICLOVIR IS RENAL, DOSAGE REDUCTIONS ACCORDING TO CREATININE CLEARANCE ARE REQUIRED FOR GANCICLOVIR FOR INJECTION.  FOR DOSING INSTRUCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL IMPAIRMENT, REFER TO DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.

                         At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 ± 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 ± 6.1 mcg·hr/mL (n=16) and Cmax ranged between 8.27 ± 1.02 (n=16) and 9 ± 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16).
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Distribution
                     
                         The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 ± 0.15 L/kg (n=98).  Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours postdose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously q8h or q12h ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations.  Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     Elimination
                     
                         When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5 mg/kg and when administered orally, it exhibits linear kinetics up to a total daily dose of 4 g/day.  Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 ± 5% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine.  Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 ± 0.8 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.2 ± 0.8 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 ± 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47).  Half-life was 3.5 ± 0.9 hours (n=98) following IV administration and 4.8 ± 0.9 hours (n=39) following oral administration.

                        The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of ganciclovir for injection solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5 mg/kg.

Based on these observations, it is necessary to modify the dosage of ganciclovir in patients with renal impairment (see

                        Hemodialysis reduces plasma concentrations of ganciclovir by about 50% after intravenous administration.

                        The effects of race/ethnicity and gender were studied in subjects receiving a dose regimen of 1,000 mg every 8 hours.  Although the numbers of blacks (16%) and Hispanics (20%) were small, there appeared to be a trend towards a lower steady-state Cmax and AUC 0-8 in these subpopulations as compared to Caucasians.  No definitive conclusions regarding gender differences could be made because of the small number of females (12%); however, no differences between males and females were observed.

                        Ganciclovir pharmacokinetics were studied in 27 neonates, aged 2 to 49 days.  At an intravenous dose of 4 mg/kg (n=14) or 6 mg/kg (n=13), the pharmacokinetic parameters were, respectively, Cmax of 5.5 ± 1.6 and 7 ± 1.6 mcg/mL, systemic clearance of 3.14 ± 1.75 and 3.56 ± 1.27 mL/min/kg, and t1/2 of 2.4 hours (harmonic mean) for both.
                        Ganciclovir pharmacokinetics were also studied in 10 pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years.  The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir were the same after single and multiple (q12h) intravenous doses (5 mg/kg).  The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.64 ± 0.22 L/kg, Cmax was 7.9 ± 3.9 mcg/mL, systemic clearance was 4.7 ± 2.2 mL/min/kg, and t1/2 was 2.4 ± 0.7 hours.  The pharmacokinetics of intravenous ganciclovir in pediatric patients are similar to those observed in adults.
