                     Drug Interactions - because of this product's effect on gastrointestinal motility and
gastric emptying, it may decrease the absorption of other oral
medications during concurrent use such as: urinary alkalizers; thiazide
diuretics (may cause the urine to become alkaline reducing the
effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to
formaldehyde); antimuscarinics (concurrent use may intensify
antimuscarinic effects of hyoscyamine because of secondary
antimuscarinic activities of these medications);
antacids/antidiarrheals (may reduce absorption of hyoscyamine,
concurrent use with antacids may cause urine to become alkaline,
reducing effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to
formaldehyde). Doses of these medications should be spaced 1 hour apart
from doses of hyoscyamine; antimyasthenics (concurrent use with
hyoscyamine may further reduce intestinal motility); ketoconazole
(patients should be advised to take this combination at least 2 hours
after ketoconazole); monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use
may intensify antimuscarinic side effects), opioid (narcotic analgesics
may result in increased risk of severe constipation); sulfonamides
(these drugs may precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine, increasing
the danger of crystalluria). Patients should be advised that the urine
may become blue to blue-green and the feces may be discolored as a
result of the excretion of the Methylene blue.
