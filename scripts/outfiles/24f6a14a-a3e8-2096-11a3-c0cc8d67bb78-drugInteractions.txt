                        The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics.  Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics or tranquilizers.
                        The finding that metoclopramide releases catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggests that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
                        Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished (e.g., digoxin) by metoclopramide, whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g., acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine).
                        Gastroparesis (gastric stasis) may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patients.  Exogenously administered insulin may begin to act before food has left the stomach and lead to hypoglycemia.  Because the action of metoclopramide will influence the delivery of food to the intestines and thus the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment.
