                  The pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered iopamidol in normal
subjects conform to an open two-compartment model with first order
elimination (a rapid alpha phase for drug distribution and a slow beta
phase for drug elimination). The elimination serum or plasma half-life
is approximately two hours; the half-life is not dose dependent. No
significant metabolism, deiodination, or biotransformation occurs.
Iopamidol is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream from cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF); following intrathecal administration, iopamidol apperrs in
plasma within one hour and virtually all of the drug reaches the
systemic circulation within 24 hours, Iopamidol is excreted mainly
through the kidneys following intrthecal administration, and the drug
is essentially undetectable in the plasma 48 hours later. In patients
with impaired renal function, the elimination half-life is prolonged
dependent upon the degree of impairment. In the absence of renal
dysfunction, the cumulative urinary excretion for iopamidol, expressed
as a percentage of administered intravenous dose is approximately 35 to
40 percent at 60 minutes, 80 to 90 percent at 8 hours, and 90 percent
or more in the 72- to 96-hour period after admininstration. In normal
subjects approximately 1 percent or less of the administered dose
appears in cumulative 72- to 96-hour fecal specimens. Iopamidol
displays little tendency to bind to serum or plasma proteins. No
evidence of in vivo complement activation has been found in normal
subjects. Animal studies indicate that iopamidol does not cross the
blood-brain barrier to any significant extent following intravascular
administration.
