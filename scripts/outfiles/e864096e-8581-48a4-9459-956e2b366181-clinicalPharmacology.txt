                  Orally administered erythromycin base and its salts are readily 
absorbed in the microbiologically active form. Interindividual variations in the 
absorption of erythromycin are, however, observed, and some patients do not 
achieve optimal serum levels. Erythromycin is largely bound to plasma proteins. 
After absorption, erythromycin diffuses readily into most body fluids. In the 
absence of meningeal inflammation, low concentrations are normally achieved in 
the spinal fluid but the passage of the drug across the blood-brain barrier 
increases in meningitis. Erythromycin crosses the placental barrier, but fetal 
plasma levels are low. The drug is excreted in human milk. Erythromycin is not 
removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.
                  In the presence of normal hepatic function, erythromycin is concentrated in 
the liver and is excreted in the bile; the effect of hepatic dysfunction on 
biliary excretion of erythromycin is not known. After oral administration, less 
than 5% of the administered dose can be recovered in the active form in the 
urine.
                  ERY-TAB tablets are coated with a polymer whose dissolution is pH dependent. 
This coating allows for minimal release of erythromycin in acidic environments, 
e.g., stomach. The tablets are designed for optimal drug release and absorption 
in the small intestine. In multiple-dose, steady-state studies, ERY-TAB tablets 
have demonstrated adequate drug delivery in both fasting and non-fasting 
conditions. Bioavailability data are available from Abbott Laboratories, Dept. 
422.
