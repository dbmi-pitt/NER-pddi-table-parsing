                  When administered intravenously, solutions containing
carbohydrate in the form of dextrose restore blood glucose levels
and provide calories. Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may aid
in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein sparing
action. Dextrose injection undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide and
water.
                  Water is an essential constituent
of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body
weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to
three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss
by perspiration and urine production).
                  Water
balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution
depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body
compartments, and sodium (NA+) plays a major role in maintaining
physiologic equilibrium.
