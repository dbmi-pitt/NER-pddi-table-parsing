                        Intravenous Administration
                     
                     
Intravenous infusion of Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection 
                        (I.V.) 
                     over 20 minutes results in peak plasma levels of imipenem antimicrobial activity that range from 14 to 24 mcg/mL for the 250 mg dose, from 21 to 58 mcg/mL for the 500 mg dose, and from 41 to 83 mcg/mL for the 1000 mg dose. At these doses, plasma levels of imipenem antimicrobial activity decline to below 1 mcg/mL or less in 4 to 6 hours. Peak plasma levels of cilastatin following a 20-minute intravenous infusion of Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection 
                        (I.V.) 
                     range from 15 to 25 mcg/mL for the 250 mg dose, from 31 to 49 mcg/mL for the 500 mg dose, and from 56 to 88 mcg/mL for the 1000 mg dose.
                  The plasma half-life of each component is approximately 1 hour. The binding of imipenem to human serum proteins is approximately 20% and that of cilastatin is approximately 40%. Approximately 70% of the administered imipenem is recovered in the urine within 10 hours after which no further urinary excretion is detectable. Urine concentrations of imipenem in excess of 10 mcg/mL can be maintained for up to 8 hours with Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection 
                        (I.V.) 
                     at the 500-mg dose. Approximately 70% of the cilastatin sodium dose is recovered in the urine within 10 hours of administration of Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection
                         (I.V.).
                     
                  
                  No accumulation of imipenem/cilastatin in plasma or urine is observed with regimens administered as frequently as every 6 hours in patients with normal renal function.
                  In healthy elderly volunteers (65 to 75 years of age with normal renal function for their age), the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of imipenem 500 mg and cilastatin 500 mg administered intravenously over 20 minutes are consistent with those expected in subjects with slight renal impairment for which no dosage alteration is considered necessary. The mean plasma half-lives of imipenem and cilastatin are 91 ± 7 minutes and 69 ± 15 minutes, respectively. Multiple dosing has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either imipenem or cilastatin, and no accumulation of imipenem/cilastatin is observed.
                  Imipenem, when administered alone, is metabolized in the kidneys by dehydropeptidase I resulting in relatively low levels in urine. Cilastatin sodium, an inhibitor of this enzyme, effectively prevents renal metabolism of imipenem so that when imipenem and cilastatin sodium are given concomitantly, fully adequate antibacterial levels of imipenem are achieved in the urine.
                  After a 1 gram dose of Imipenem and Cilastatin for Injection 
                        (I.V.)
                     , the following average levels of imipenem were measured (usually at 1 hour post dose except where indicated) in the tissues and fluids listed:
                  


                  


Imipenem-cilastatin sodium is hemodialyzable. However, usefulness of this procedure in the overdosage setting is questionable. (See

                        .

The bactericidal activity of imipenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Its greatest affinity is for penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) 1A, 1B, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of 
                        Escherichia coli
                     , and 1A, 1B, 2, 4 and 5 of 
                        Pseudomonas aeruginosa
                     . The lethal effect is related to binding to PBP 2 and PBP 1B.
                  Imipenem has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases produced by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. It is a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamases from certain gram-negative bacteria which are inherently resistant to most beta-lactam antibiotics, e.g., 
                        Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia 
                     spp., and 
                        Enterobacter 
                     spp.
                  Imipenem has 
                        in vitro 
                     activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Imipenem has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both 
                        in vitro 
                     and in clinical infections treated with the intravenous formulation of imipenem-cilastatin sodium as described in the

When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide to the physician the results of 
                        in vitro 
                     susceptibility tests for antimicrobial drug products used in resident hospitals as periodic reports which describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial.

Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a broth dilution method1,2 or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of imipenem powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to criteria provided in Table 1.

Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations2,3. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 10-mcg imipenem to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to imipenem. The disk diffusion interpretive criteria should be interpreted according to criteria provided in Table 1.

For anaerobic bacteria, the susceptibility to imipenem as MICs can be determined by standardized test methods2,4. The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to criteria provided in Table 1.  
                  The MIC and disk diffusion values obtained should be interpreted according to the following criteria:
                  


                  


A report of “Susceptible” indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound at the infection site reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of “Intermediate” indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of “Resistant” indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound at the infection site reaches the concentrations usually achievable, and that other therapy should be selected.

Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test. Quality control microorganisms are specific strains of organisms with intrinsic biological properties. QC strains are very stable strains which will give a standard and repeatable susceptibility pattern. The specific strains used for microbiological quality control are not clinically significant. Standard imipenem powder should provide the following range of values noted in Table 2.2
