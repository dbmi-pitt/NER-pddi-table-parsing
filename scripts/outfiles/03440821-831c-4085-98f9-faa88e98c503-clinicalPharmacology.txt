                  Pharmacokinetic testing in healthy adult subjects has demonstrated that a single 30 mg dose of a capsule or tablet will result in equivalent extent of absorption. Peak plasma levels were observed to occur about 3 hours after dosing. The mean elimination half-life for oxazepam was approximately 8.2 hours (range 5.7 to 10.9 hours).
                  This product has a single, major inactive metabolite in man, a glucuronide excreted in the urine.
                  Age (<80 years old) does not appear to have a clinically significant effect on oxazepam kinetics. A statistically significant increase in elimination half-life in the very elderly (>80 years of age) as compared to younger subjects has been reported, due to a 30% increase in volume of distribution, as well as a 50% reduction in unbound clearance of oxazepam in the very elderly. (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).
