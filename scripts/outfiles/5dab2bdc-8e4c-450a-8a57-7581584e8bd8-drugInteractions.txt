                        No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dipyridamole USP Tablets. The following information was obtained from the literature.
                        
                           Adenosine: Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary.
                        
                           Cholinesterase Inhibitors: Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis.
