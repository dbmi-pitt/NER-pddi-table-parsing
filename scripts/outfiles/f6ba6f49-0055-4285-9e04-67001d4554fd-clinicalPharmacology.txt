                        KERYDIN is an oxaborole antifungal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics

                     
                        At therapeutic doses, KERYDIN is not expected to prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent.

                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.3 Pharmacokinetics

                     
                        Tavaborole undergoes extensive metabolism. Renal excretion is the major route of elimination.

                        In a clinical pharmacology trial of six healthy adult male volunteers who received a single topical application of 5% 14C-tavaborole solution, tavaborole conjugates and metabolites were shown to be excreted primarily in the urine.

                        The pharmacokinetics of tavaborole was investigated in 24 subjects with distal subungual onychomycosis involving at least 4 toenails (including at least 1 great toenail) following a single dose and a 2-week daily topical application of 200 μL of a 5% solution of tavaborole to all ten toenails and 2 mm of skin surrounding each toenail. Steady state was achieved after 14 days of dosing. After a single dose, the mean (± standard deviation) peak concentration (Cmax) of tavaborole was 3.54 ± 2.26 ng/mL (n=21 with measurable concentrations, range 0.618-10.2 ng/mL, LLOQ=0.5 ng/mL), and the mean AUClast was 44.4 ± 25.5 ng*hr/mL (n=21). After 2 weeks of daily dosing, the mean Cmax was 5.17 ± 3.47 ng/mL (n=24, range 1.51-12.8 ng/mL), and the mean AUCτ was 75.8 ± 44.5 ng*hr/mL.

                                 Mechanism of Action
                              
                              The mechanism of action of tavaborole is inhibition of fungal protein synthesis. Tavaborole inhibits protein synthesis by inhibition of an aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase (AARS).

                              Tavaborole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]:

                                 Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum strains from isolates collected in the clinical trials have not demonstrated resistance following repeated exposure to tavaborole.
