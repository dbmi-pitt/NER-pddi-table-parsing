                           VIAGRA can potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, alpha blockers, and anti-hypertensives (4.1, 5.5, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 12.2) 
                           With concomitant use of alpha blockers, initiate VIAGRA at 25 mg dose (2.3)
                           CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin):  Increase VIAGRA exposure (2.4, 7.4, 12.3)
                                 Ritonavir: Do not exceed a maximum single dose of 25 mg in a 48 hour period (2.4, 5.6)
                                 Erythromycin or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, saquinavir): Consider a starting dose of 25 mg (2.4, 7.4)
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1	Nitrates
                     
                        Administration of VIAGRA with nitric oxide donors such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form is contraindicated. Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway, VIAGRA was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)
                           ].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2	Alpha-blockers
                     
                        Use caution when co-administering alpha-blockers with VIAGRA because of potential additive blood pressure-lowering effects. When VIAGRA is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating VIAGRA treatment and VIAGRA should be initiated at the lowest dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3),Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)
                           ].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3		Amlodipine
                     
                        When VIAGRA 100 mg was co-administered with amlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) to hypertensive patients, the mean additional reduction on supine blood pressure was 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)
                           ].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4		Ritonavir and other CYP3A4 inhibitors
                     
                        Co-administration of ritonavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, greatly increased the systemic exposure of sildenafil (11-fold increase in AUC). It is therefore recommended not to exceed a maximum single dose of 25 mg of VIAGRA in a 48 hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                           ].
                        Co-administration of erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in a 160% and 182% increases in sildenafil Cmax and AUC, respectively. Co-administration of saquinavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in 140% and 210% increases in sildenafil Cmax and AUC, respectively. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole could be expected to have greater effects than seen with saquinavir. A starting dose of 25 mg of VIAGRA should be considered in patients taking erythromycin or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as saquinavir, ketoconazole, itracanozole) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
                           ].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.5 	Alcohol
                     
                        In a drug-drug interaction study sildenafil 50 mg given with alcohol 0.5 g/kg in which mean maximum blood alcohol levels of 0.08% was achieved, sildenafil did not potentiate the hypotensive effect of alcohol in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)
                           ].
