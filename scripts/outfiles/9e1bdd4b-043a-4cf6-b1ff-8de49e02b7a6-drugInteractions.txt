                        Prospective studies on the potential for hydroxyurea to interact with other drugs have not been performed.
                        Concurrent use of hydroxyurea and other myelosuppressive agents or radiation therapy may increase the likelihood of bone marrow depression or other adverse events. (See WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS.)
                        Since hydroxyurea may raise the serum uric acid level, dosage adjustment of uricosuric medication may be necessary.
