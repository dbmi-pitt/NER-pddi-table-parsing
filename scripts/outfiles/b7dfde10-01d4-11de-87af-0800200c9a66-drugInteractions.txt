                           Cimetidine increases oral nicardipine plasma levels. (7.2)
                           
                           Oral nicardipine increases cyclosporine plasma levels.  Monitor cyclosporine levels when co-administering Cardene I.V. Premixed Injection. (7.3)
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.1 Beta-Blockers
                     
                        In most patients, Cardene I.V. Premixed Injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta blockers.  However, titrate slowly when using Cardene I.V. Premixed Injection in combination with a beta-blocker in heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
                        
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2 Cimetidine
                     
                        Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration.  Frequently monitor response in patients receiving both drugs.  Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3 Cyclosporine
                     
                        Concomitant administration of oral nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels.  Closely monitor plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during Cardene I.V. Premixed Injection administration, and reduce the dose of cyclosporine accordingly.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4 In Vitro Interaction
                     
                        The plasma protein binding of nicardipine was not altered when therapeutic concentrations of furosemide, propranolol, dipyridamole, warfarin, quinidine, or naproxen were added to human plasma in vitro.
