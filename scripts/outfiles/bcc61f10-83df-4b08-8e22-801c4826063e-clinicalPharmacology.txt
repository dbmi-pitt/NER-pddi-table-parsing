                  The acid pH of most intravenous solutions has been implicated as a factor in the production of postinfusion (chemical) phlebitis not caused by obvious infection.  Vein irritation, with local redness and tenderness near the site of venipuncture or along the course of a vein, appears to be related to the nature of the substances in the infusion and the speed (insufficient dilution by the bloodstream) as well as the duration (prolonged exposure of the intima) of infusion.  Other contributing factors include the size of the vein used for venipuncture, shape or method of insertion of the venipuncture needle, the use or type of indwelling catheter, infection at the infusion site and the age of the patient (children and females seem to be more susceptible).
                  The pH of commonly used dextrose infusion solution ranges from 3.5 to 6.5.  Other commonly used solutions also may have an acid pH.  Since parenteral solutions with a low (acid) pH are known to cause chemical irritation of tissues, it is not surprising that chemical phlebitis may occur as a complication with their infusion.  Vein irritation is most likely when the duration of infusion is long or when hemo-dilution is minimized by a large needle in a small vein.  The amount of sodium bicarbonate recommended as an additive to neutralize acid parenteral solutions is too small to exert a clinically significant increase in electrolyte content.
