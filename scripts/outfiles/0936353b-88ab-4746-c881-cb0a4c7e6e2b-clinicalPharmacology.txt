                  Aminosyn II (an amino acid injection) provides crystalline
amino acids to promote protein synthesis and wound healing, and to
reduce the rate of endogenous protein catabolism. Aminosyn II, given
by central venous infusion in combination with concentrated dextrose,
electrolytes, vitamins, trace metals, and ancillary fat supplements,
constitutes total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Aminosyn II can also
be administered by peripheral vein with dextrose and maintenance electrolytes.
Intravenous fat emulsion may be substituted for part of the carbohydrate
calories during either TPN or peripheral vein administration of Aminosyn
II.
