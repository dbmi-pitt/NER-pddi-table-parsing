                  Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid. It is a normal constituent of tissues and blood. The alpha-hydroxy acids (and their salts) are felt to act as humectants when applied to the skin. This property may influence hydration of the stratum corneum. In addition, lactic acid, when applied to the skin, may act to decrease corneocyte cohesion. The mechanism(s) by which this is accomplished is not yet known.
                  An in vitro study of percutaneous absorption of ammonium lactate cream using human cadaver skin indicates that approximately 6.1% of the material was absorbed after 68 hours.
