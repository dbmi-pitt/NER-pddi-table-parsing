                     7.1  Ergot-Containing Drugs
                     
                        Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.2  Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors
                     
                        MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.3  Other 5-HT1 Agonists
                     
                        Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of sumatriptan tablets and other 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.4  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome
                     
                        Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
