                        Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine by cytochrome 
CYP 3A4. Because CYP 3A4 inhibitors may increase plasma concentrations of 
buprenorphine, patients already on CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals 
(e.g. ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin), and HIV protease 
inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir and saquinavir) should have their dose of 
SUBUTEX or SUBOXONE adjusted.
                        Based on anecdotal reports, there may be an interaction between buprenorphine 
and benzodiazepines. There have been a number of reports in the post-marketing 
experience of coma and death associated with the concomitant intravenous misuse 
of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines by addicts. In many of these cases, 
buprenorphine was misused by self-injection of crushed SUBUTEX tablets. SUBUTEX 
and SUBOXONE should be prescribed with caution to patients on benzodiazepines or 
other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these 
drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse. 
Patients should be warned of the potential danger of the intravenous 
self-administration of benzodiazepines while under treatment with SUBOXONE or 
SUBUTEX.
