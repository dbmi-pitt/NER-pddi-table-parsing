                        Additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist,                                     if available. When introducing additives, use aseptic technique,                                     mix thoroughly and do not store.
                        Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for                                     particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration,                                     whenever solution container permits. (See
