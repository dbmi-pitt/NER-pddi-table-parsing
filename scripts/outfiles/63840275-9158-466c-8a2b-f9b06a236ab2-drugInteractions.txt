                           concerning solutions containing a vasoconstrictor.
                        If sedatives are employed to reduce patient apprehension, use reduced doses, since local anesthetic agents, like sedatives, are central nervous system depressants which in combination may have an additive effect.
                        Marcaine® 0.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000 injection should be used cautiously in persons with known drug allergies or sensitivities, particularly to the amide-type local anesthetics.
                        Serious dose-related cardiac arrhythmias may occur if preparations containing a vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine are employed in patients during or following the administration of chloroform, halothane, cyclopropane, trichloroethylene, or other related agents. In deciding whether to use these products concurrently in the same patient, the combined action of both agents upon the myocardium, the concentration and volume of vasoconstrictor used, and the time since injection, when applicable, should be taken into account.
