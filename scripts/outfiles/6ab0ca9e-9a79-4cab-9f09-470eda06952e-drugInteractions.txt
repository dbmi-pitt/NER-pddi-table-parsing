                        Generalized seizures have been reported in patients who received ganciclovir and imipenem and cilastatin for injection. These drugs should not be used concomitantly unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. 
                        Since concomitant administration of imipenem and cilastatin for injection and probenecid results in only minimal increases in plasma levels of imipenem and plasma half-life, it is not recommended that probenecid be given with imipenem and cilastatin for injection. 
                        Imipenem and cilastatin for injection should not be mixed with or physically added to other antibiotics. However, imipenem and cilastatin for injection may be administered concomitantly with other antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides. 
                        Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including imipenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid (see
