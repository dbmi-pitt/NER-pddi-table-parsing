                        Cyclosporine increased rosuvastatin exposure (AUC) 7‑fold.  Therefore, in patients taking cyclosporine, the dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 5 mg once daily [see

                        Gemfibrozil significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure. Due to an observed increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis, combination therapy with CRESTOR and gemfibrozil should be avoided. If used together, the dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 10 mg once daily  [see

                     7.3 Protease Inhibitors
                     
                        Coadministration of rosuvastatin with certain protease inhibitors has differing effects on rosuvastatin exposure. Simeprevir, which is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, or combinations of atazanavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir, which are HIV-1 protease inhibitors,  increase rosuvastatin exposure (AUC) up to threefold [see Table 4 –
                              Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)
                           ]. For these protease inhibitors, the dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 10 mg once daily. The combinations of fosamprenavir/ritonavir or tipranavir/ritonavir, which are HIV-1 protease inhibitors, produce little or no change in rosuvastatin exposure. Caution should be exercised when rosuvastatin is coadministered with protease inhibitors [see

                     7.4 Coumarin Anticoagulants
                     
                        CRESTOR significantly increased INR in patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants. Therefore, caution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with CRESTOR.  In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and CRESTOR concomitantly, INR should be determined before starting CRESTOR and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs [see

                        The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when CRESTOR is used in combination with lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin; caution should be used when prescribing with CRESTOR [see
                              Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
                           ].
                     
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     7.6 Fenofibrate
                     
                        When CRESTOR was coadministered with fenofibrate, no clinically significant increase in the AUC of rosuvastatin or fenofibrate was observed. Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concomitant use of fenofibrates, caution should be used when prescribing fenofibrates with CRESTOR [see
                              Warnings and Precautions (5.1)

                        Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing CRESTOR with colchicine [see
