                           Drug Interactions with Other CNS Depressants
                           
                              The concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers and alcohol may produce additive depressant effects. Respiratory depression, hypotension and profound sedation or coma may occur. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets should not be taken with alcohol. Opioid analgesics, including Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, may enhance the action of neuromuscular blocking agents and produce an excessive degree of respiratory depression.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics
                           
                              Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, and buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as hydromorphone. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of hydromorphone and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.
