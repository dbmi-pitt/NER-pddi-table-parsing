                           Anticoagulants (oral)
                        
                        The activity of oral anticoagulants may be potentiated by anti-vitamin-K activity attributed to methimazole.
                        
                           ß-adrenergic blocking agents
                        
                        Hyperthyroidism may cause an increased clearance of beta blockers with a high extraction ratio. A dose reduction of beta-adrenergic blockers may be needed when a hyperthyroid patient becomes euthyroid.
                        
                           Digitalis glycosides
                        
                        Serum digitalis levels may be increased when hyperthyroid patients on a stable digitalis glycoside regimen become euthyroid; a reduced dosage of digitalis glycosides may be required.
                        
                           Theophylline
                        
                        Theophylline clearance may decrease when hyperthyroid patients on a stable theophylline regimen become euthyroid; a reduced dose of theophylline may be needed.
