                        Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin. Coadministration of probenecid cannot be recommended.
                        Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized ratio [INR]) has been reported rarely in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.
                        The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. There are no data with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium and allopurinol administered concurrently.
                        In common with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives.
