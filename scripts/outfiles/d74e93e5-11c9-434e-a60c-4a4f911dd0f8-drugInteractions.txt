                        Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension and chewable tablets may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin. Co-administration of probenecid cannot be recommended.
                        The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. There are no data with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension and chewable tablets and allopurinol administered concurrently.
                        In common with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension and chewable tablets may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives.
