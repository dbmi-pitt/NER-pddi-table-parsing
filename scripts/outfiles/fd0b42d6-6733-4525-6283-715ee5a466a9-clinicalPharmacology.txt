                  Novamine® 15% Amino Acids Injection provides
seventeen crystalline amino acids. This completely utilizable substrate promotes
protein synthesis and wound healing and reduces the rate of protein catabolism.
                  A.
Total Parenteral Nutrition (Central Infusion)
                  When enteral
feeding is inadvisable, Novamine® 15% given by central venous
infusion in combination with energy sources, vitamins, trace elements and
electrolytes, will completely satisfy the requirements for weight maintenance
or weight gain, depending upon the dose selected. The energy component in
parenteral nutrition by central infusion may be derived solely from dextrose
or may be provided by a combination of dextrose and intravenous fat emulsion.
The addition of intravenous fat emulsion provides essential fatty acids and
permits a dietary balance of fat and carbohydrate, at the same time offering
the option of reducing the dextrose load and/or increasing the total caloric
input. An adequate energy supply is essential for optimal utilization of amino
acids.
                  B. Total Parenteral Nutrition (Peripheral Infusion)
                  Novamine® 15%
can also be administered as part of a total parenteral nutrition program by
peripheral vein when the enteral route is inadvisable and use of the central
venous catheter is contraindicated.
                  Reduction of protein
loss can be achieved by use of diluted Novamine® 15% in combination
with dextrose or with dextrose and intravenous fat emulsion by peripheral
infusion. Complete peripheral intravenous nutrition can be achieved in patients
with low caloric requirements by a Novamine®15%-dextrose-fat
regimen.
