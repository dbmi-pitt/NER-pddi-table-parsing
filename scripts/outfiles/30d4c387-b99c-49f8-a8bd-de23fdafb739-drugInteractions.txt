                        Although the pressor activity of desmopressin acetate is very low, its use with other pressor agents should be done only with careful patient monitoring.  The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDS, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution.
                        DDAVP® Injection has been used with epsilon aminocaproic acid without adverse effects.
