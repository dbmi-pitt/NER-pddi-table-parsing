                           MAOI and tricyclic antidepressants may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines.
                           Beta-adrenergic blockers and MAOI may potentiate the pressor effect of pseudoephedrine.
                           Concurrent use of digitalis glycosides may increase the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias.
                           Sympathomimetics may reduce the hypotensive effects of guanethidine, mecamylamine, methyldopa, reserpine and veratrum alkaloids.
                           Concurrent use of tricyclic antidepressants may antagonize the effects of pseudoephedrine.
                           Concomitant use of antihistamines with alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants may have an additive effect.
