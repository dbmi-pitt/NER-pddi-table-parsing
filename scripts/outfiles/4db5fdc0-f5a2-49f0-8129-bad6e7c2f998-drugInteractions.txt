                        Prazosin hydrochloride has been administered without any adverse drug interaction in limited clinical experience to date with the following: (1) cardiac glycosides-digitalis and digoxin; (2) hypoglycemics-insulin, chlorpropamide, phenformin, tolazamide, and tolbutamide; (3) tranquilizers and sedatives-chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and phenobarbital; (4) antigout-allopurinol, colchicine, and probenecid; (5) antiarrhythmics-procainamide, propranolol (see WARNINGS however), and quinidine; and (6) analgesics, antipyretics and anti-inflammatories-propoxyphene, aspirin, indomethacin, and phenylbutazone.
                        Addition of a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent to prazosin has been shown to cause an additive hypotensive effect. This effect can be minimized by reducing the prazosin dose to 1 mg to 2 mg three times a day, by introducing additional antihypertensive drugs cautiously and then by retitrating prazosin based on clinical response.
                        Concomitant administration of prazosin hydrochloride with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
