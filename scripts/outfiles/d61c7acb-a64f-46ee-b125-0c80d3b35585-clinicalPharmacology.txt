                     12.1 Mechanism of Action
                     
                        Taclonex Scalp® Topical Suspension combines the 
pharmacological effects of calcipotriene hydrate as a synthetic vitamin D3 analogue and betamethasone dipropionate as a synthetic 
corticosteroid. However, while their pharmacologic and clinical effects are 
known, the exact mechanisms of their actions in psoriasis vulgaris are unknown.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     
                     
                     12.2 Pharmacodynamics
                     
                        
                           Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis 
Suppression: 
                        
                        HPA axis suppression was evaluated in adult subjects (N=32) with extensive 
psoriasis involving at least 30% of the scalp and, in total, 15-30% of the body 
surface area. Treatment consisted of once daily application of Taclonex 
Scalp® Topical Suspension on the scalp in combination 
with Taclonex® Ointment on the body for 4 to 8 weeks. 
Adrenal suppression as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level 
≤ 18 mcg/dL was observed in 5 of 32 subjects (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment 
and in 2 of 11 subjects (18.2%) who continued treatment for 8 weeks.
                        
                           Effects on Calcium Metabolism:
                        In the study described above, the effects of once daily application of 
Taclonex Scalp® Topical Suspension on the scalp in 
combination with Taclonex® Ointment on the body for 4 to 
8 weeks on calcium metabolism were also examined. Following once daily 
application of Taclonex Scalp® Topical Suspension on the 
scalp in combination with Taclonex® Ointment on the body, 
elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in two 
subjects (one at 4 weeks and one at 8 weeks).

                           Taclonex Scalp® Topical 
Suspension:
                        The systemic effect of Taclonex Scalp® Topical 
Suspension in extensive psoriasis was investigated in the study described above. 
In this study, the serum levels of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate 
and their major metabolites were measured after 4 and 8 weeks of once daily 
application of Taclonex Scalp® Topical Suspension on the 
scalp in combination with Taclonex® Ointment on the body. 
Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate were below the lower limit of 
quantification in all serum samples of the 34 subjects evaluated.
                        However, one major metabolite of calcipotriene (MC1080) was quantifiable in 
10 of 34 (29.4%) subjects at week 4 and in five of 12 (41.7%) subjects at week 
8. The major metabolite of betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 
17-propionate (B17P) was also quantifiable in 19 of 34 (55.9%) subjects at week 
4 and seven of 12 (58.3%) subjects at week 8. The serum concentrations for 
MC1080 ranged from 20-75 pg/mL. The clinical significance of this finding is 
unknown.
                        
                           Metabolism
                        
                        
                           Calcipotriene:
                        Calcipotriene metabolism following systemic uptake is rapid and occurs in the 
liver. The primary metabolites of calcipotriene are less potent than the parent 
compound. 
                        Calcipotriene is metabolized to MC1046 (the α,ß-unsaturated ketone analog of 
calcipotriene), which is metabolized further to MC1080 (a saturated ketone 
analog). MC1080 is the major metabolite in plasma. MC1080 is slowly metabolized 
to calcitroic acid.
                        
                           Betamethasone dipropionate:
                        Betamethasone dipropionate is metabolized to betamethasone 17-propionate and 
betamethasone, including the 6ß-hydroxy derivatives of those compounds by 
hydrolysis. Betamethasone 17-propionate (B17P) is the primary metabolite.
