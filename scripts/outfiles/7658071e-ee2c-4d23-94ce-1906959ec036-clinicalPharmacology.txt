                  Amphetamines are noncatecholamine, sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity. Peripheral actions include elevations of systolic and diastolic blood pressures and weak bronchodilator and respiratory stimulant action.
                  There is neither specific evidence that clearly establishes the mechanism whereby amphetamines produce mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system.

                        Ingestion of 10 mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate in oral solution form by healthy volunteers produced an average peak dextroamphetamine blood level of 33.2 ng/mL. The half-life was 11.75 hours. The average urinary recovery was 38% in 48 hours.
                        In 12 healthy subjects, the rate and extent of dextroamphetamine absorption were similar following administration of the sustained release capsule formulation in the fed (58 to 75 gm fat) and fasted state.
