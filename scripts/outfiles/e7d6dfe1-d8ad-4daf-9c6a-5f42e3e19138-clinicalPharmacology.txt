                  Phosphorus in the form of organic and inorganic phosphate has a variety of important biochemical functions in the body and is involved in many significant metabolic and enzyme reactions in almost all organs and tissues.  It exerts a modifying influence on the steady state of calcium levels, a buffering effect on acid-base equilibrium and a primary role in the renal excretion of hydrogen ion.
                  Phosphorus is present in plasma and other extracellular fluid, in cell membranes and intracellular fluid, as well as in collagen and bone tissues.  Phosphate in the extracellular fluid is primarily in inorganic form, and plasma-levels may vary somewhat with age.  The ratio of disodium phosphate and monosodium phosphate in the extracellular fluid is 4:1 (80%:20%) at the normal pH of 7.4.  This buffer ratio varies with the pH, but owing to its relatively low concentration, it contributes little to the buffering capacity of the extracellular fluids.
                  Phosphate, present in large amounts in erythrocytes and other tissue cells, plays a significant intracellular role in the synthesis of high energy organic phosphates.
                  Hypophosphatemia should be avoided during periods of total parenteral nutrition, or other lengthy periods of intravenous infusions.  Serum phosphate levels should be regularly monitored, and appropriate amounts of phosphate should be added to the infusions to maintain normal serum phosphate levels.  Intravenous infusion of inorganic phosphate may be accompanied by a decrease in the serum level and urinary excretion of calcium.  Intravenously infused phosphate not taken up by the tissues is excreted almost entirely in the urine.
