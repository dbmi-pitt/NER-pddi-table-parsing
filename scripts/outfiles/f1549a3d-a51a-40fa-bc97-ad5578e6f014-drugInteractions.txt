                        When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents:
                     
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Anesthetics, general
                           
                              Exaggeration of the hypotension induced by general anesthetics (see WARNINGS: Major Surgery).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin)
                           
                              Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia; adjust dosage of antidiabetic drug accordingly (see WARNINGS: Diabetes and Hypoglycemia).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine)
                           
                              Additive effect; monitor closely for evidence of hypotension and/or excessive bradycardia (e.g., vertigo, syncope, postural hypotension).
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Digitalis glycosides
                           
                              Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.
                           
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           
                           
                           Response to Treatment for Anaphylactic Reaction
                           
                              While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction.
