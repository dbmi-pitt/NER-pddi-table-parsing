                  Droperidol produces marked tranquilization and sedation.
It allays apprehension and provides a state of mental detachment and indifference
while maintaining a state of reflex alertness.
                  Droperidol
produces an antiemetic effect as evidenced by the antagonism of apomorphine
in dogs. It lowers the incidence of nausea and vomiting during surgical procedures
and provides antiemetic protection in the postoperative period.
                  Droperidol
potentiates other CNS depressants. It produces mild alpha-adrenergic blockade,
peripheral vascular dilatation and reduction of the pressor effect of epinephrine.
It can produce hypotension and decreased peripheral vascular resistance and
may decrease pulmonary arterial pressure (particularly if it is abnormally
high). It may reduce the incidence of epinephrine-induced arrhythmias but
it does not prevent other cardiac arrhythmias.
                  The onset
of action of single intramuscular and intravenous doses is from three to ten
minutes following administration, although the peak effect may not be apparent
for up to thirty minutes. The duration of the tranquilizing and sedative effects
generally is two to four hours, although alteration of alertness may persist
for as long as twelve hours.
