The fetus, neonate, elderly and euthyroid patients with underlying thyroid disease (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis or with Grave's disease previously treated with radioiodine or surgery) are among those individuals who are particularly susceptible to iodine-induced hypothyroidism. Oral cholecystographic agents and amiodarone are slowly excreted, producing more prolonged hypothyroidism than parenterally administered iodinated contrast agents. Long-term amino-glu-tethimide therapy may minimally decrease T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> levels and increase TSH, although all values remain within normal limits in most patients.</td>

In patients treated with large doses of propranolol ( &gt; 160 mg/day), T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> levels change slightly, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. It should be noted that actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when the hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T<sub>3</sub> concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T<sub>4</sub> levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> levels due to decreased TBG production (see above).</td>
