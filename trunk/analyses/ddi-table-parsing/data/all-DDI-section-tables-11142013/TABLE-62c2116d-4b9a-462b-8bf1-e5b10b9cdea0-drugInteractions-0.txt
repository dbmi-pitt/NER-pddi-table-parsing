<td align="left" valign="top">If coadministration of methadone and didanosine is necessary, the recommended formulation of dianosine is didanosine delayed-release. Patients should be closely monitored for adequate clinical response when didanosine delayed-release is coadministered with methadone, including monitoring for changes in HIV RNA viral load. Do not coadminister methadone with didanosine pediatric powder due to significant decreases in didanosine concentrations.</td>

Thus, although not studied, it is possible that coadministration with heavier meals could reduce didanosine concentrations further.</footnote>
