<td>Protease inhibitor:<br/>  atazanavir</td>
<td>↓atazanavir concentration<br/>↑ tenofovir concentration</td>
<td>Coadministration of atazanavir with ATRIPLA is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with either efavirenz or tenofovir DF decreases plasma concentrations of atazanavir. The combined effect of efavirenz plus tenofovir DF on atazanavir plasma concentrations is not known. Also, atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. There are insufficient data to support dosing recommendations for atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with ATRIPLA.</td>

<tr>
<td>Protease inhibitor:<br/>  fosamprenavir calcium</td>
<td>↓ amprenavir concentration</td>
<td>Fosamprenavir (unboosted):  Appropriate doses of fosamprenavir and ATRIPLA with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established.<br/>
<br/>Fosamprenavir/ritonavir:  An additional 100 mg/day (300 mg total) of ritonavir is recommended when ATRIPLA is administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily. No change in the ritonavir dose is required when ATRIPLA is administered with fosamprenavir plus ritonavir twice daily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Protease inhibitor:<br/>  indinavir</td>
<td>↓ indinavir concentration</td>
<td>The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz, is not known. Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Protease inhibitor:<br/>  lopinavir/ritonavir</td>
<td>↓ lopinavir concentration<br/>↑ tenofovir concentration</td>
<td>A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir to 600/150 mg (3 tablets) twice daily may be considered when used in combination with efavirenz in treatment-experienced patients where decreased susceptibility to lopinavir is clinically suspected (by treatment history or laboratory evidence). <content stylecode="bold">Patients should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions</content>. 											</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Protease inhibitor:<br/>  ritonavir</td>
<td>↑ ritonavir concentration<br/>↑ efavirenz concentration</td>
<td>When ritonavir 500 mg every 12 hours was coadministered with efavirenz 600 mg once daily, the combination was associated with a higher frequency of adverse clinical experiences (e.g., dizziness, nausea, paresthesia) and laboratory abnormalities (elevated liver enzymes). Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when ATRIPLA is used in combination with ritonavir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Protease inhibitor:<br/>  saquinavir</td>
<td>↓ saquinavir concentration</td>
<td>Should not be used as sole protease inhibitor in combination with ATRIPLA.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CCR5 co-receptor antagonist:<br/>  maraviroc</td>
<td>↓ maraviroc concentration</td>
<td>Efavirenz decreases plasma concentrations of maraviroc. Refer to the full prescribing information for maraviroc for guidance on coadministration with ATRIPLA.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NRTI:<br/>  didanosine</td>
<td>↑ didanosine concentration</td>
<td>Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis and neuropathy. <content stylecode="bold">In patients weighing &gt;60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg if coadministered with ATRIPLA</content>.<content stylecode="bold"> Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for patients weighing &lt;60 kg. Coadministration of ATRIPLA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. For additional information, please consult the Videx / Videx EC (didanosine) prescribing information.</content>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Anticonvulsants:<br/>  carbamazepine</td>
<td>↓ carbamazepine concentration<br/>↓ efavirenz concentration</td>

<td>  phenytoin<br/>  phenobarbital</td>
<td>↓ anticonvulsant concentration<br/>↓ efavirenz concentration</td>
<td>Potential for reduction in anticonvulsant and/or efavirenz plasma levels; periodic monitoring of anticonvulsant plasma levels should be conducted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Antidepressants:<br/>  bupropion</td>
<td>↓ buproprion concentration</td>
<td>The effect of efavirenz on bupropion exposure is thought to be due to the induction of bupropion metabolism. Increases in bupropion dosage should be guided by clinical response, but the maximum recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  sertraline</td>
<td>↓ sertraline concentration</td>
<td>Increases in sertraline dose should be guided by clinical response.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Antifungals:<br/>  itraconazole</td>
<td>↓ itraconazole concentration<br/>↓ hydroxy-itraconazole concentration</td>
<td>Since no dose recommendation for itraconazole can be made, alternative antifungal treatment should be considered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  ketoconazole</td>
<td>↓ ketoconazole concentration</td>
<td>Drug interaction trials with ATRIPLA and ketoconazole have not been conducted. Efavirenz has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of ketoconazole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  posaconazole</td>
<td>↓ posaconazole concentration</td>
<td>Avoid concomitant use unless the benefit outweighs the risks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Anti-infective:<br/>  clarithromycin</td>
<td>↓ clarithromycin concentration<br/>↑ 14-OH metabolite concentration</td>
<td>Clinical significance unknown. In uninfected volunteers, 46% developed rash while receiving efavirenz and clarithromycin. No dose adjustment of ATRIPLA is recommended when given with clarithromycin. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Other macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, have not been studied in combination with ATRIPLA.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Antimycobacterial:<br/>  rifabutin</td>

<td>Increase daily dose of rifabutin by 50%. Consider doubling the rifabutin dose in regimens where rifabutin is given 2 or 3 times a week.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Antimycobacterial:<br/>  rifampin</td>
<td>↓ efavirenz concentration</td>
<td>If ATRIPLA is coadministered with rifampin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an additional 200 mg/day of efavirenz is recommended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Calcium channel blockers:<br/>  diltiazem</td>
<td>↓ diltiazem concentration<br/>↓ desacetyl diltiazem concentration<br/>↓ N-monodes-methyl diltiazem concentration</td>
<td>Diltiazem dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the full prescribing information for diltiazem). No dose adjustment of ATRIPLA is necessary when administered with diltiazem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  Others (e.g., <br/>  felodipine, nicardipine, <br/>  nifedipine, verapamil)</td>
<td>↓ calcium channel blocker</td>
<td>No data are available on the potential interactions of efavirenz with other calcium channel blockers that are substrates of CYP3A. The potential exists for reduction in plasma concentrations of the calcium channel blocker. Dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the full prescribing information for the calcium channel blocker).</td>

<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oral:<br/>  ethinyl<br/>  estradiol/norgestimate</td>
<td>↓ active metabolites of norgestimate</td>
<td>A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. Efavirenz had no effect on ethinyl estradiol concentrations, but progestin levels (norelgestromin and levonorgestrel) were markedly decreased. No effect of ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate on efavirenz plasma concentrations was observed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Implant:<br/>  etonogestrel</td>
<td>↓ etonogestrel</td>
<td>A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. The interaction between etonogestrel and efavirenz has not been studied. Decreased exposure of etonogestrel may be expected. There have been postmarketing reports of contraceptive failure with etonogestrel in efavirenz-exposed patients.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Immunosuppressants:<br/>  cyclosporine, <br/>  tacrolimus, sirolimus, <br/>  and others <br/>  metabolized by <br/>  CYP3A</td>
<td>↓ immuno-suppressant</td>
<td>Decreased exposure of the immunosuppressant may be expected due to CYP3A induction by efavirenz. These immunosuppressants are not anticipated to affect exposure of efavirenz. Dose adjustments of the immunosuppressant may be required. Close monitoring of immunosuppressant concentrations for at least 2 weeks (until stable concentrations are reached) is recommended when starting or stopping treatment with ATRIPLA.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Narcotic analgesic:<br/>  methadone</td>
<td>↓ methadone concentration</td>
<td>Coadministration of efavirenz in HIV-1 infected individuals with a history of injection drug use resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal. Methadone dose was increased by a mean of 22% to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be monitored for signs of withdrawal and their methadone dose increased as required to alleviate withdrawal symptoms.</td>
