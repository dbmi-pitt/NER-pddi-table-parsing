Headings were extracted using queries to TableAnnotator loaded with
SPLs in December of 2016. Two students worked together to mark the
data for table headers related to drug drug interactions (see
Heading_NoHeading_Annotations). These were then processed using
MetaMap and Genia in January of 2017.
