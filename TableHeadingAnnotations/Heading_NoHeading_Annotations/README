Headings were extracted using queries to TableAnnotator loaded with
SPLs in December of 2016. Two students worked together to mark the
data for table headers related to drug drug interactions.

- the first sheet has 449 headers and stub cells. Most of these look like column headers. These marked for ones that ARE NOT headers

- the second sheet has header cells that are not also stub cells. Maybe half or more of these do not look like true column headers. These were marked for which ones ARE headers
